(12, 'CONCEPT OF ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM\nOnline voting system is an online voting technique, which is also called e-voting. There are two types of e-voting which one is physically monitored and supervised by representative of governmental or independent electoral authorities with specialize voting kiosk while the other type is a remote e-voting via the internet where voters vote at home or any place of their choice without going to a polling station. In this system people of Ogun State and whose age is above 18 years of age and any sex can give his\\her vote online without going to any physical polling station. There is a database which is maintained in which all the names of voters with complete information is stored. In online voting system a voter can use his\\her voting right online without any difficulty. He\\She has to be registered first for him/her to vote. Registration is mainly done by the system administrator for security reasons. The system Administrator registers the voters on a special site of the system visited by him only by simply filling a registration form to register voter. people seeking registration are expected to contact the system administrator to submit their details. After the validity of them being indigene of Ogun state has been confirmed by the system administrator by comparing their details submitted with those in existing databases such as those as the Registrar of Persons, the people is then registered as a voter. After registration, the voter is assigned a secret Voter ID with which he/she can use to log into the system and enjoy services provided by the system such as voting. If invalid/wrong details are submitted, then the citizen is not registered to vote.', 'introduction', 'NDII', '12/69/0124', 'online voting system', 'Mrs. Funmi Lawal', '2017-01-26 08:49:30'),
(13, 'BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\nThe Online voting system (OVS) also known as e-voting is a term encompassing several different types of voting embracing both electronic means of counting votes. The goals and objectives of this project is to provide an online votingplatform for Ogun State independent electoral commission (OGSIEC) so as to create an automated online voting technique that will improved the current conventional method of voting in the state. The commission is a subsidiary of INEC and they organize and conduct election of local government in Ogun State. Electronic voting technology can include punched cards, optical scan voting systems and specialized voting kiosks (including self-contained direct-recording electronic voting systems or DRE). It can also involve transmission of ballots and votes via telephones, private computer networks, or the internet.\nOnline voting is an electronic way of choosing leaders via a web driven application. The advantage of online voting over the common queue method is that the voters have the choice of voting at their own free time and there is reduced congestion. It also minimizes on errors of vote counting. The individual votes are submitted in a database which can be queried to find out who of the aspirants for a given post has the highest number of votes. This system is geared towards increasing the voting percentage in Nigeria since it has been noted that with the old voting method {the Queue System}, the voter turnout has been a wanting case. With system in place also, if high security is applied, cases of false votes shall be reduced. With the online voting system, a voter can use his\\her voting right online without any difficulty. He\\She has to register as a voter first before being authorized to vote. The registration should be done prior to the voting date to enable data update in the database. However, not just anybody can vote. For one to participate in the elections, he/she must have the requirements. For instance, he/she must be a registered citizen i.e. must be 18 and above years old. As already stated, the project Online Voting'' provides means for fast and convenient voting and access to this system is limited only to registered voters. Internet voting systems are appealing for several reasons which include; People are getting more used to work with computers to do all sorts of things, namely sensitive operations such as shopping and home banking and they allow people to vote far from where they usually live, helping to reduce absenteeism rate.', 'methodology', 'NDII', '12/69/0124', 'online voting system', 'Mrs. Funmi Lawal', '2017-01-26 08:49:30'),

(19, 'The internet is serving as an aid for solving varieties of problems with the available resources it contains and solutions that is being developed to ease communication and flow of information between humanity and also as a repository for information storage and retrieval globally. One of the major objective of the internet as a resource to foster technology buildup is the promotion of business activities and planning through the development of business oriented websites and other varieties of business supports.\nNormally, the quality of people hired is the key metric for measuring the effectiveness of the employment function, but in certain circumstances, the speed of hiring may actually be a more significant contributor to quality hiring. A good productive hiring is not a matter of putting an advertisement in the newspaper, setting up some chairs and tables on the appointed day, and then taking in some resumes to be followed up later. The purpose of a hiring event is to reach out to prospective employees and bring the specific kind of skills and experiences in the organization especially those which cannot be built from within. The question is how this could be made possible (Shafique, 2012).\nThis project is a web based platform which will provide optimum aid in the acquisition and information availability over job applications, enrolment and the need to make information available based on job employment request placement inform of news and also to connect online job requesters to job placement organizations through the upload s of CVs, job profile management and organizational mailing notification. This project is a website to be designed using PHP server scripting, MySQL database, jQuery plugin, and other web development resource tools.\n\n1.2	PROBLEM STATEMENT \nBasic traditional recruiting begins with processing an application form. In addition, detailed employment standards are set and a job description for each position is offered. Application forms and resumes should be verified with the scope of verification increasing according to the importance of the position to be filled. Finally, performance tests and other evaluation aids can help in finding the best person for the job. However, this method may take much time and effort (Mary & Rex, 2013).\n1.	The traditional hiring process (i.e., from advertisement of job positions to hiring of successful applicants) has its own inherent weaknesses. \n2.	The advertisement of job positions alone may pose a problem. It is costly to advertise through print media (e.g., newspapers or magazines). \n3.	Thus, the publication of job positions can only be advertised for a short period of time. \n4.	Also, the system of submission requires the physical presence of the applicant to hand over the resume. \n5.	This hampers the application of competent yet geographically secluded job seekers. \n6.	Thus, old recruitment practices might not be suitable in todays competitive environment.\n7.	There is no adequate provision for notification, aid for CV development and update, and also absence of feedback system. \n\n1.3	PROJECT AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\nThe project is aim to design a website that support job application news publication and enrolment platform which fosters organizations to applicants relationship. Below are some other objectives of the project:\n1.	To review related works on job enrolment platform.\n2.	To design a system that encourages concurrent update of job availability news through a push notification system.\n3.	To provide an easy way for job applicants to reach out to organization in need of employees.\n4.	To implements a website that introduces categorizations in job enrolment search and encourages exchange of applicants enrolment documents.\n5.	To improve the reduction in the cost of job placement and enrolment by attachment of an auto CV construct platform.\n6.	To evaluate a well-organized online system of information to reach out to every angle of the world on the availability of job or office space with an enrolment feedback system.\n\n1.4	PROJECT SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS\nThis project will be designed using web programming languages and plugins which includes (Html, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, and PHP) for the user interface and business logic and MySQL database for the backend storage. The design and implementation will entails the following:\n1.	An administrative platform for organizations to register new availability of jobs, request for companies approval for employment placement via document confirmation and to management the employment placement and update.\n2.	The website home platform serving as a news publication for the view for job availability and website updates and other associated news, and also provide platform for applicants and organizations registration and enrolment.\n3.	There will be a managerial interface for applicants to manage and update their application profile, submit CVs and other application documents during enrolments, and also perform other related tasks.\n4.	An interface to access applicants, and organizations push notification.\n5.	A file directory to store related uploads that is made on the website.\n6.	A platform to access feedbacks on jobs enrolment and application updates\n7.	A database to store all related information that is controls the website.\n\n1.5	DEFINITION OF TERMS\n1.	Application Documents: (check internet for definition and update here)\n2.	Business Support: (check internet for definition and update here)\n3.	CV (Curriculum Vitae): a short written document that lists personal details, education, skills, and previous jobs, which is sent to employers when looking for a job.\n4.	Feedback System: A system designed with a platform or subsystem that handles the return of information about the result of a process or activity; an evaluative response.\n5.	Job Application: a verbal or written request or an approach made for job employment\n6.	Push Notification: a notification or alert platform that is accessed and attached to the top-right corner a website page header.\n7.	Recruitment: the act of getting recruits; enlisting people for the army or for a job or a cause etc.\n', 'introduction', 'HND', '11/69/0011', 'online job placement manager system', 'Mr Orunsolu', '2017-04-13 09:13:10'),
(20, 'RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nThis project undergoes a preliminary investigation of research before the commencement of the design process as needed to ensure accuracy and efficiency of the project productivity. For it being a review on existing works, it requires some research resources and also few related projects in the likes of recruitment system; job employment management; CV generation; and some others were looked into in terms of how they works and the importance of feedback system in some of the related works. Out of the study was the generation of this project titled Online Job Placement Manager System. The research method adopted was online based data research process through the use of search engine.\n3.1.1	ADOPTED METHOD (INTERNET AND ONLINE ARCHIVES JOURNALS)\nThe internet as a very useful and always available important platform for information access was used to locate some information related to Job application, employment and enrolment procedures; www.google.com was visited and through this search engine record books were downloaded, and information was also accessed from websites like www.wikipedia.com/Online-employment, http://www.smeal.psu.edu/employment, http://www.wikipedia.com/online-job, and so on. More also, some logical state were also considered on how to relate the generation of CV and designing of a job application system, with the adopted script language for designing the project employment enrolment, CV creation and submission and feedback system. \n3.2	DESIGN METRHODOLOGY\nThis project was design and executed as a web application platform was and the majorly adopted design tools; database, script, and algorithm used are as follows:\n3.2.1	PHP WEB APPLICATION SCRIPT DESIGN TOOLS\nPHP is a programming language for building dynamic, interactive Web sites. As a general rule, PHP programs run on a Web server, and serve Web pages to visitors on request. One of the key features of PHP is that it can be embedded within HTML Web pages, making it very easy to create dynamic content quickly. It is deep enough to run the largest social network (Facebook), it is also easy enough to be a beginner''s first server side language. It also establish unlimited behavioral scripting communication relationship with MySQL database server which makes an appropriate tools for driving web.\n3.2.2	MYSQL DBMS\nMySQL is used as the database server or DBMS engine to test the web application script on. This provides environment to create a database and the tables in it. This server stores users personal details, security details, and any other user oriented required data storage need which is perfectly useful for testing both native application, web application, and any other database driven application or websites. \n3.2.3	JQUERY SCRIPTING\njQuery UI is a set of plug-ins for jQuery that add new functionalities to the jQuery core library. From a high level, jQuery UI was, and still is, a collection of plugins and utilities that build on jQuery. But dig deeper and you find a set of consistent, well-documented, theme-able building blocks to help you create everything from small websites to highly complex web applications. The stability and ease of use of jQuery UI led to continuous growth in the librarys popularity. The library is now used in 19% of the top 10,000 sites on the web, and has been incorporated into WordPress core and Drupal.\n\n3.3	DATABASE DESIGN\nThis project website does have a backend storage directory for CVs and database called jobplacement designed in MySQL database server hosted in the same localhost server with the web application; it also consists of eight different tables which includes: applicants, organizations, cvs, login_details, jobs, job_categories, notifications, and feedbacks. The table one below shows the names and description of the purpose served by each of the database table that the project is made of:\nS/N	Tables	Descriptions\n1	Applicants	This table is designed to store registered applicants personal profiles.\n2	Organizations	This table is designed to store the profiles of companies requesting for employees.\n3	CVs	This table is to store the curriculum vitae created by online applicants.\n4	Login_details	This table stores the login profiles of each website users, be it applicants or employee seekers.\n5	Jobs	This table stores the lists of jobs posted by registered organizations and companies seeking for job applicants to fill a job posts.\n6	Job_categories	This table stores all added lists of job categories in order to filter job application search.\n7	Notifications	This table keep logs of every push notifications attached to the website.\n8	Feedbacks	This table records feedbacks from registered organizations to applicants and also feedbacks from applicants back to the organizations.\nTable 1: A table showing the descriptions of  jobplacement database tables\n\n3.4	ONLINE JOB PLACEMENT MANAGER SYSTEM\nThis website is designed on the focus of three phases and three additional focus to its content scope, these phases range from the website homepage giving the visitors the access to signup, login, and also to follow the website news on job placement availability on the website; the organizations page to manage login and organizational profile, manage and update applicants request info, add a new job vacancy to the website for people to reach out to, send and manage applicants received feedbacks, and also access received notifications; and the applicants page which is equipped with the resources for viewing and searching for lists of available jobs open to enrolment, update website profile, create and adjust the CV platform designed on the website, access and manage notifications and feedbacks from organizations that an applicant is connected with.\nThe architecture below in figure 1 projects the total breakdown of the web application operations from the home page to the applicants page:\n \nFigure 1: architecture of online job placement manage website\n\n3.5	ONLINE JOB PLACEMENT MANAGER WEBSITE DESIGN FLOWCGHART \n \nFigure 2: Flowchart for Online job placement manager system.\n', 'methodology', 'HND', '11/69/0011', 'online job placement manager system', 'Mr Orunsolu', '2017-04-13 09:16:18'),
(21, 'QR code (abbreviated from Quick Response Code) is a kind of 2-dimensional barcode which has a wide range of uses because the code is high efficiency and good performance in error correction. QR code is now one of most popular ways to store information in barcodes. These applications on mobile devices provide QR scanning and online or offline translation of a single static QR code. Once the Smartphone detects a QR code, it will stop detecting and decode the information in the received code.\nThe purpose of Top-up QR code scanner application is to make user easy to reload their top-up. Other than that this application is to make user make to reload the prepaid.  A QR code consists of black modules (square dots) arrange in a square and on a white background, which can be read by an imaging device (such as a camera, scanner etc) and processing using Reed-Solomon error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. The required data are then extracted from patterns that are presents in both horizontal and vertical components of the image.\nAlthough initially used to track parts in vehicle manufacturing, storing a companys information such as address and related information alongside its alpha-numeric text data as can be seen in yellow pages directory and in-store product labeling. Users may receive a text, add a vCard contact to their device, open a URL, or compose an e-mail or text message after scanning QR codes. They can generate and print their own QR codes for others to scan and use by visiting one of several pay or free QR code-generating sites or apps.\nQR codes have been common in consumer advertising. Typically, a Smartphone is used as a QR code scanner, displaying the code and converting it to some useful form. QR code has become a focus of advertising strategy, since it provides a way to access a brands website more quickly than by manually entering a URL. Beyond mere convenience to the consumer, the importance of this capability is that it increases the conversion rate by conversion funnel with little delay or effort, bringing the viewer to the advertisers website immediately, where a longer and more targeted sales pitch may lose the viewers interest.\nQR codes storing addresses and URLs may appear in magazines, on signs, on buses, on business cards, or on almost any object about which users might want information. Users with a camera phone equipped with the correct reader application can scan the image of the QR code to display text, contact information, connect to a wireless network, or open a web page in the telephones browser. This act of linking from physical world objects is termed hard linking or objects hyper linking. QR codes also may be linked to a location to track where a code has been scanned. Either the application that scans the QR code retrieves the geo-information by using CIPs or cell lower triangulation or the URL encoded in the QR code itself is associated with a location. Using a two-dimensional scheme, these codes provide more information than the standard bar codes commonly used for product inventory by manufacturers and retailers.  Unlike bar codes, which must be read with a light beam, QR codes are read with an optical device similar to the camera on a typical smart phone.  With smart phone market share over 50% of all mobile phones (ComScore, 2012) and rising, the ability to access QR code information is more omnipresent than ever.  \nQR codes, which are a form of action tags, have several inherent advantages over traditional bar codes.  First, the software to build them is free and can be used without license.  Second, they are capable of containing more information within the same footprint as a bar code.  Third, any smart device with a camera and the proper application software can read them, and the application is free to the user.  \nQR codes are not the only form of action tag.  Microsoft tags and digital water marks are also examples in the retail space of embedding gateways to additional information, features and/or security.  However, QR codes currently represent 85 percent of all action tags in use in the top 100 magazines. (Matus, 2012)  The purpose of this study is to gauge how widespread is consumer adoption of QR codes and which applications are most often used.\n\n\n1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT\nBefore carrying out a project to develop this application, the developer must make a deep study and research on the current trends and need to find a problem that arise.  \n	Take time to reload the top up for users that use the Smartphone and prepaid card.  Nowadays, each person will have one Smartphone because affordable price. The current step on reloading prepaid is taking time because prepaid users need to enter 16 digits to reload the prepaid. It`s taking time to complete the task. In this era, everybody wants to work or task complete in a short time and easily.  \n	Sometime user will mistakenly enter the prepaid card number and need to enter the number back.  User just can only memorize 4 numbers in the short time. To complete the reloading step, user need to memorize 4 numbers and its repeated 4 times because each prepaid card consists of 16 digits. When user mistakenly enters the number, they need to re-enter back the number and user need repeat the step. Indirectly, this means the user needs to take time and inconvenience of having to repeat the steps to reloading prepaid until it successful.\n	To prevent shoulder surfing attacks i.e. someone looking over your shoulder to get your recharge card pin.\n\n\n1.3       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY	\n	To load the cad using qrcode\n	To help user to save time to reload their top-up\n	To improve the step of reloading top-up for users who are using a Smartphone\n	To enhance security by converting the recharge card pin to qrcode\n	Project Objective \n	The project objective is the way that developer needs to list and implement into the application to encounter the problem statement that already been listed and to make the application is better than the current step.  \n\n1.4         SCOPE OF THE PROJECT\nThe scope of this project is to scan recharge card using QR code for intended users.\n1.5          INTENDED USERS\n Android Smartphone and Prepaid Card The intended user for my project is the people that use Smartphone and prepaid card. This project is targeted to the prepaid user and using Smartphone because it is easy to use and time-saving. For user that use mobile phone still can use the current step to enter the top-up.\n\n1.6       DEFINITION OF TERMS\nBarcode: A barcode is an optical, machine-readable, representation of data, the data usually describes something about the object that carries the barcode. A barcode can be found in a variety of different formats including ID, or linear, 2D and 3D variations. Barcodes are read by scanners that read small images of lines, bars and spaces and translate these symbols into data.\nBarcode symbology: The mapping between messages and barcode is called a symbology. The specification of a symbology includes the encoding of the single digits/characters of the message. They are generally classified into two different classes. Continuous vs Discrete and two-width vs many-width.\nBidirectional Barcodes: A directional barcode scanning device is a device that retains the same functionality in terms of reading information encoded on a barcode label as a conventional barcode scanner.\n2D Barcodes: A 2D (two dimensional) barcode is a graphical image that stores information both horizontally and vertically. 2D offers a far greater informational capacity than a 1D barcode. They enable fast data access and can be used in conjunction with mobile phone marketing.\n2D Barcode Scanner: 2D Barcode scanner utilizes a small video camera to capture 2D Barcode. This type of scanner can read regular 2D Barcodes, as well as QR codes and other variations.\n', 'introduction', 'HND', '12/69/0376', 'Mobile Topup using quick response code', 'Mr Adebayo', '2017-04-18 11:07:47'),

(23, '1.1	BACKGROUND OF STUDY\nThe growth of the Internet has dramatically changed the way in which data is managed, accessed and used commercially to conduct business electronically. Electronic transaction is not new; however, recent rapid development of the Internet is surely responsible for the popularity of electronic transactions. The new way of commerce through the Internet creates vast opportunities, but at the same time, this new way of commerce poses challenges. The Internet is a global network, which contains many networks. Therefore, the Internet is a network of networks. Connecting a business to the Internet implies a global reach. In other words, a company can reach anyone who has an access to the Internet such as customers, suppliers, on-line banks, mediators, etc. At the same time, the company can be reached by anyone. As mentioned above, the Internet creates vast opportunities for businesses, but at the same time poses some threats, which if they are not taken care properly will destroy businesses. For example, anybody from anywhere on the Internet (an intruder or a hacker) can illegally enter a company computer resource and messes the computer resource from a remote site. In addition, it is not difficult task to tap a message in the middle of the net and steal or change its content, which is surely a very serious matter.\nThe world we are living today is not only in the hype of internet revolution but also it is a world in which many of the traditional businesses are fully dependent on electronic channels. In United Kingdom the government has plans to put all the public services online. Simply, E-commerce is now a mainstream part of the most organizations. The organisations are investing enormous amount of their capital in E-commerce to achieve competitive advantage over others in the market. For several years the internet has been more and more used as a trade platform for all kind of goods and in general internet shopping becomes increasingly popular. Traditional companies and institutions are making use of e-commerce to overcome the boundaries of space and time: it allows them to globalize their operations and offer a more personalized service to the customer. Moreover, many entrepreneurs took advantage of the benefits of e-commerce and created new business models. E-commerce is fast gaining ground as an accepted and used business paradigm. More and more business houses are implementing web sites providing functionality for performing commercial transactions over the web. It is reasonable to say that the process of shopping on the web is becoming commonplace. It has greatly evolved for forty years of existence and is still evolving continuously, as well as the software offered to support it. When searching for e-commerce solutions, almost all offered systems are focused on building web-shops, despite of the fact that electronic commerce is not just about web shopping any longer. Due to the great increase in the awareness of internet and the technologies associated with it, several opportunities are coming up on the web. So many businesses and companies now venture into their business with ease because of the internet.\nWhile the Internet is dramatically changing the way business is conducted, security and                 privacy issues are of deeper concern than ever before. The Internet is basically an insecure communication medium. Hawker (2000) states that the only assumption which can safely be made when considering the Internet as a communication medium is that it offers no security whatsoever. Most people are skeptical about the security of the Internet. People are happy using the World Wide Web for browsing, finding, reading or downloading information from the Internet. However, when considering sending a credit card number over the Internet, they are reluctant to do it, even if they are told that the transfer is secured. (Mohammed Nabir Albutanwar et al 2011)\n\n\n1.2	STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\n	As industries are fast expanding, people are seeking for more ways to purchase products, advertise their products, sell their product, check for product prices with much ease and still maintain cost effectiveness. The vendors need to purchase the products in order to sell to end users. The manual method of going to a local product sales outlet, or to a complex, supermarket, mall to purchase product is becoming obsolete and more tasking. Products can be ordered through the internet and payment made without going to the complex or supermarket. So there is need for a wide range of publicity and enabling direct order, processing and delivering of products through online system. Therefore the following are list of problem statement :\na.	Security: Many individuals have been known to have tried to ensure security of electronic    transactions but all to no avail because these individuals make use of the wrong protection utility. E-secured transactions are very prone to the risk of hacking if the proper protection utility or software is not used. (Ajeet Singh et al 2012).\nb.	Cost: The cost of ensuring proper safety in electronic transactions is now so expensive that many online marketers dont even use the right protection software again, instead they look for cheap ones that they can manage and this stands as a problem of e-secured transactions.\nc.	Reduced Authenticity: This is another factor that poses as a problem to secured online payment system, due to the various security problems that is been faced by online markets, there is a reduction in the authenticity of goods.\nd.	Lack of technical specialists: Finally, another problem that an electronic transaction experience is in the area of knowledgeable specialists. Secured online payment system can only be ensured by knowledgeable specialists as well as versatile technologist but it is so difficult to find versatile technologists when it ensuring the safety of online transactions and marketing.\n\n1.3	AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\nThe objectives of this project are as follows.\n	To ensure security of financial transactions made on via the internet.\n	To Increase the assurance of safety for online buyers and sellers.\n	developments.\n	To ensure security of payment gateway made on via the internet.\n	Developing an e-commerce platform that can be used by customers to order for purchase a product and make payment online.\n	To Increase the assurance of safety for online buyers and sellers.\n	To provide the capability of buying and selling products on the Internet.\n\n1.4	SCOPE AND LIMITATION\nDue to the nature of Internet, security and authenticity of payments and participants cannot be guaranteed with technologies that are not specifically designed for e-commerce. We need an e-commerece system that would not only provide secure payments but should also have properties like online customer and merchant authentication, unforgivable proof of transaction authorization by the customer both to the merchant and the bank, privacy of customer and transaction of data to a research that was made in 1993 and then again in 1999, it provides a sense of uncertainty and taking risks when purchasing online. Over the years there is lot of e-commerce technology that has been developed. This helps the customers in many ways in terms of convenience and accessibility. But still the security of their hard earned money is left unanswered. Now an e-secured technology is developed known as the Secure Payment System. It is a mode of operation wherein the security of financial transactions done on the Internet is ensured to be safe.\n\n1.5     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nThe advantages of secure e-commerce for business entities can be summarized thus: ecommerce can increase sales and decrease costs. A firm can use e-commerce to reach narrow market segments that are widely scattered geographically. The internet and the web are particularly useful in creating virtual communities that become ideal target markets. A virtual community is a gathering of people who share a common interest, but, instead of this gathering occurring in the physical world; it takes place on the internet. So the secured e-commerce platform developed will assist to:\n1.	Increase sales opportunities for the seller, thereby increasing purchasing opportunities for the buyer.\n2.	Provide buyers with a wider range of choices than traditional commerce, because they can consider many different products and services from a wider variety of sellers.\n3.	The benefits of e-commerce also extend to the general welfare of society. Electronic payments for goods cost less to issue and arrive securely and quickly when transmitted via the Internet.\n4.	Furthermore, electronic payments can be easier to audit and monitor than payments made by check, which can help protect against fraud and theft.\n5.	E-Commerce platform can make products and services available in remote areas.\n6.	E-Commerce keep accurate record on purchased order and delivery, reduce time wasted in data processing and reduce the workload in the present system\n\n\n\n\n1.6      DEFINITION OF TERMS\na.	Electronic payment systems: This covers systems for online financial exchange between buyers and sellers. This exchange is usually in some form of digital financial instrument, such as e-cash, smart cards, credit/debit cards, and electronic checks.\nb.	Marketing and advertising: This consists of the application of EC to marketing and advertising, including brand-name management, disseminating product catalogs, and sales information and product announcements.\nc.	E-Commerce: E-commerce is the buying and selling of goods and services, or the transmitting of funds or data, over an electronic network, primarily the internet.\nd.	Payment Gateway: A payment gateway is a merchant service provided by an e-commerce application service provider that authorizes credit card or direct payments processing for e-businesses.\ne.	Authorizing:  Approving the buyers details \nf.	Clearing: Sending details of transaction to merchants bank \ng.	Reporting: Tracking all transactions \n', 'introduction', 'HND', '11/69/0062', 'secured ecommerce system using machine learning algorithm', 'Mr Adebayo', '2017-04-18 11:13:05'),
(24, '3.0   RESEARCH AND DESIGN METHODOLOGY\n3.1   RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nGenerally, in the course of study, several methods can be used in order for successful data collection to be carried out, aimed for the project to be exposed to ease and flexibility in maintenance approach, those methods that were adopted are:\n3.1.1  DIRECT INTERVIEW\nThis is a direct one on one communication process with an individual or organization involves so as to acquire data about the project of study. I visited the student of Computer Science Department Moshood Abiola Polytechnic so as to demand information and their opinion about developing an online interactive forum website to enhance communication among them.\n3.1.2 ONLINE CONSULTATION \nIn order to attain guidelines and study some related approaches in designing this system, we had to consult the internet study sampled related reports and interactive forums to support the design process and also gather historical source of interactive forums.\n\n3.2 DESIGN METHODOLOGY\nWhile executing the design process, there exist tools preferences for the website development with reasons to justify why these tools are selected. We concluded to use one of the scripting language called PHP and Wamp testing server for MySql database development of the system and for testing the website on localhost.\n3.2.1 WEBSITE DESIGN TOOL\nPHP is an object based scripting language used to design both a dynamic websites. The major reason behind the choice of PHP over all other scripting languages like asp.net, aspx.net etc. is that it requires lower resources to execute, it filters out memory that are not being used during utilization and of course it is highly secured and easy to learn. \n\n3.2.2 DATABASE DESIGN TOOL\nDatabase is needed for easily storage, retrieval, and update of data-items generally refers to as a repository for data. There are several choices of databases but the one being chosen as a database choice is MySql due to the luxurious acquisition of data, its flexibility in querying of database, and its nonselective connection to all computer object oriented scripting and programming languages (it is compatible with any object oriented language).\n\n3.3 WEBSITE ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS\nE-secured transaction platform is a web-based application intended to provide automated solution and services to customer. It allows online shopping customers to place items in the cart.  Upon checkout the software calculates as total for the order including shipping and handling postage, packing and taxes, if applicable.  The Shopping Cart used in e-commerce to assist people making purchases products online. It provides the user a catalog of different products available in the system. In order to purchase a shopping cart is provided to the user. The Security in transaction process is a very important feature added to this study, customer debit cart are secured using a one way hashing algorithm operation to prevent customer paypal card from being hacked. The shopping cart application has been developed to allow business grows larger and faster.  This site will let customers to view and order products online from any part of the world. Under this website many products and services can be ordered. The shopping cart is expanded permanently through new products and services in order to offer a product portfolio corresponding to the market.\n\n3.4 DATABASE DESCRIPTION\nThe website interface communicates with a database named e-security which consists of four major database tables, a database populating tables for storing backend registered users personal details and login information. Each table work with the other in order for the application to work effectively. These database tables are: users, internet_shop, messages, website database and its tables each is also being tabulated with their various properties in figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A hierarchy Showing the database Description\n3.4.1 Users\nThis table holds the basic information of registered front desk and backend users alongside with their login details; it is made of four columns.\nSN	ATTRUBUTES	TYPE OF DATA	LENGTH	CONSTRAINTS\n1	User_Id	INTEGER	10	PRIMARY KEY, AUTO INCREMENT\n2	Username	VARCHAR	20	UNIQUE KEY\n3	Password	VARCHAR	20	\n4	Position	VARCHAR	70	\nTable 1: The tabulated description of users database table\n3.4.2 Internet Shop\nThe table store the records of registered product to be sold and it is made up of five columns.\nSN	ATTRUBUTES	TYPE OF DATA	LENGTH	CONSTRAINTS\n1	id	INTEGER	10	Primary Key, Auto Increment\n2	Image	VARCHAR	15	\n3	Name	VARCHAR	100	\n4	Description	TEXT		\n5	Price	VARCHAR	12	\nTable 2: Tabulation describing the data specification of internet_shop table.\n3.4.3 Orders\nThis table stores product/goods that the customer has requested for, it contain seven columns.\nSN	ATTRUBUTES	TYPE OF DATA	LENGTH	CONSTRAINTS\n1	id	INTEGER	10	Primary Key, Auto Increment\n2	Product	VARCHAR	70	\n3	Qty	VARCHAR	20	\n4	Confirmation	VARCHAR	15	\n5	Total	VARCHAR	20	\n6	Design	VARCHAR	20	\n7	Note	TEXT		\nTable 3: The tabulated description of orders database table.\n\n3.4.4 Reservation\nThis table contains record of all customers and it is made of sixteen columns.\nSN	ATTRUBUTES	TYPE OF DATA	LENGTH	CONSTRAINTS\n1	Reservation_id	INTEGER	10	Primary Key, Auto Increment\n2	First_Name	VARCHAR	30	\n3	Last_Name	TEXT		\n4	City	VARCHAR	15	\n5	Address	VARCHAR	30	\n6	Country	VARCHAR	30	\n7	Email	VARCHAR	30	\n8	Contact	VARCHAR	30	\n9	Payable	INEGER	11	\n10	Status	VARCHAR	10	\n11	Confirmation	VARCHAR	20	\n12	Delivery	VARCHAR	300	\n13	Date	DATE		\n14	Time	VARCHAR	100	\n15	Payment	VARCHAR	100	\n16	Delivery Type	VARCHAR	100	\n\n\n3.4.5 Message: \nHere is the table contain the feedback or comment of the services and application by the customer and it contains five columns which are described in table 5.\n\n\nSN	ATTRUBUTES	TYPE OF DATA	LENGTH	CONSTRAINTS\n1	Message_id	INTEGER	10	Primary Key, Auto Increment\n2	Name	VARCHAR	50	\n3	Email	VARCHAR	30	\n4	Message	VARCHAR	50	\nTable 5: The tabulated description of Message database table.\n\n3.5 SECURITY MECHANISM BEHIND WEBSITE\nThe security mechanism that is applied on this website is termed password authentication process where after a user has register with his or her personal details, he will be redirected to the login interface to supply the username and password being used. The website will request the database to check for the availability of the supplied detail before granting or restricting the user the access to manage other operations provided by the website.

(25, '1.1 	BACKGROUND OF STUDY\nBlood bank is an accumulation or bank of blood and blood components gathered as a result of blood donation or collection, stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusion. Blood bank refers to the portion of a hospital where the storage of blood products occurs and where proper a testing is performed to reduce the risk of transfusion related adverse events. However, it sometimes refers to a collection centre (Wikipedia, 2015). \nPunjab online blood bank management system defines blood bank management system as a web based application that is designed for storing, processing, retrieving and analysing information concerned with the administrative and inventory management within a blood bank. \nThe necessity for blood is important for treating in medical fields because for every second, individuals need blood to save lives. The task of blood bank is to receive blood from various donors, to monitor the blood groups database and to send the required blood during the need to the hospital in case of emergencies (P.Priya et al., 2014).\nThe idea of this system is to make the process of blood bank less time consuming as time is a very important factor due to the rapid perishable nature of blood and certain cases require blood within less time during critical situations. Moreover, the records are manually maintained in large catalogue and it is time consuming searching for a regular donors details in large catalogue. However, this software application will be able to access a donors detail and will connect various blood banks and health care centres for easy access to blood availability status in the blood banks so that individuals in need can place a request for the particular blood group needed within a short period of time (Tushar, Satish & Shinde, 2015).\nTherefore, this system aims at bringing blood banks, hospitals/health care facilities and donors under a common online platform. It is to create awareness to hospitals about available blood type and nearest blood banks in case of emergency. This software will also contain useful information regarding blood donation like what blood type is needed when hospitals has run out of it.\n1.2	 PROBLEM STATEMENT\nEighty percent (80%) of hospitals and healthcare centres in Nigeria almost always experience crisis when blood is needed and this is because most times, request for blood usually come as an emergency. We find out that patients who have lost blood either due to an accident or severe injury are usually rushed to the hospitals meanwhile, there is no little or no blood in the blood bank of the hospital making the medical practitioners disorganized when treatment is supposed to have commenced on the patient. The reason for this we believe, is due to the inefficient way the blood bank system in these healthcare centres is managed. However, in order to save lives, there is the need for an effective way of managing blood bank systems in hospitals and healthcare centres so as to improve healthcare delivery. \nThis project therefore is an attempt to provide a platform that will help speed up the provision of blood in critical situations and to help improve the blood bank management system in hospitals and other healthcare centres.\n1.3	AIM AND OBJECTIVES\nThe main aim of this project is to automate the operations of the blood bank by implementing an automated blood bank management information system.\nThe objectives are:\n1.	To provide a search option facility that will make searching very fast so that required details can be found instantly.\n2.	To provide a platform that will maintain large number of records.\n3.	To provide a platform that will display available blood in blood banks and blood type needed so that obtaining blood from a blood bank will be hassle free and corruption free.\n1. 4	 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\nThere are always limits to every aspect of solving a problem, during the course of this project, the following limitations might be perceived.\n1.	This system will not cover the globe.\n2.	Lack of financial stability to purchase a domain to host online.\n3.	Only hospitals within Nigeria will be linked to this system.\n1.5	SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nThis system is of relevance importance because by automating the operations of the blood bank, time consumption will be reduced as doctors and patients in need of blood will not have to wait for a long time. Also, donors record can be easily accessed from various parts of the state. This system will help bring together blood banks in the State under one platform so that where one blood bank is not available, others will. This software will generate a proper database to avoid the use of manual process and loss of information about donor and hospital (recipients). A proper and managed detail of every hospitals and recipients will be maintained as hospitals satisfaction will be taken into good consideration as this will in turn lead to a faster growth in profit of each of the blood banks.\n1.6	SCOPE OF THE STUDY\nThis system will be developed such that it can be used to manage and bring together blood banks in the different states in Nigeria. Also, hospitals and healthcare centres in these states that transfuse blood to patients will be registered on this platform to help solve the problem of crisis when blood is needed. \nThe software will have a blood bank admin that represents each blood bank registered on the system to give update and information about their blood bank. It will have a hospital admin that will interact with the system on behalf of the hospital to know the blood bank closest to them and the blood types available in the blood bank. It will also contain the super-admin that manages and accesses all the admins. \n1.7	DEFINITION OF TERMS\nBLOOD\nAmericas blood centers defines blood as the red fluid that circulates in our blood vessels i.e veins and arteries, of the human body and other vertebrate animals, carrying oxygen to and carbon dioxide from the tissues of the body. The blood in the human body makes up about 7% of its weight and its density is only slightly more than that of pure water. \nBLOOD BANK\nBlood banking refers to the process of collecting, testing, preparing and storing whole blood and blood components intended primarily for transfusion. Blood bank center entails the rigorous controlling, monitoring and the complete documentation of the whole procedure from blood collection to blood infusion.\nBLOOD BANK INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nBlood Bank Information Management System is an information system which helps to manage the records of donors and patient at a blood bank. It is mainly designed to store, process, retrieve and analyse information concerned with the administrative and inventory management within a blood bank. Such kind of system will allow the blood bank admin/staff to login using a secret password and easily manage the records of the blood donors and the patients in need of blood. In addition, the blood bank information management system is not obsolete to the professionals rather it plays a vital role in attracting he donors and other stakeholders due to its simplicity in the reservation and notification of donation time to the needy. On top of this, any stakeholder and/or regional blood banks in need can easily access to the type and quantity of blood available in any blood bank center.\nINFORMATION SYSTEM \nAn information system consists of input messages, message processing and output messages. It have also processing rules which control the execution of the information system. If the processing rules are formalized we can have computer based information systems. But if the processing rules need a lot of personal knowledge, judgement and intuition, the information systems a manual. A purposeful information system shall help users to make good decisions and support their actions.  \nMANAGEMENT\nManagement can be defined as the ability of getting things done through and with others (Nwachukwu, 2007 p8). It can be more scientifically defined as the co-ordination of all the resources of an organization through the process of planning, organizing, directing and controlling in order to attain organization objectives and goals.\nBLOOD DONOR\nA person who gives blood for transfusion.\nRECIPIENT\nA person of certain blood group who can in theory receive donated blood of any ABO blood group.\n BLOOD DONATION AND BLOOD TRANSFUSION:\nBlood donation is a voluntary procedure. It is a process of accepting to have blood drawn from the body so that it can be given to someone who needs blood transfusion or blood during surgery. \n BLOOD COMPONENTS\nBlood is a specialized body fluid. It is a highly specialized tissue composed of more than 4,000 different kinds of components. It has four main components which include: red cells, white cells, platelets and plasma (Dennis O''Neil, 2013).\na) RED BLOOD CELLS: This is also called erythrocytes. It makes up about 45% of the bloods volume. They are tiny biconcave disc-shaped cells. Red blood cells contains hemoglobin, a protein that gives blood its red color and enables it to carry oxygen from the lungs and delivers it to all the body tissues. Red blood cells are made in the bone marrow and they survive for about four months; they are destroyed and recycled by the liver and spleen. They are destroyed because they have to constantly change shape to pass through narrow blood vessels. When they die, the hemoglobin is stored in the liver and is used to make new blood cells in the bone marrow. There are about five million red cells in 1 cubic centimeter of blood. The rest that is not stored is converted into bile pigments.\nb) WHITE BLOOD CELLS: This is also called leucocytes or leukocytes. It makes up 0.1% of the bloods volume. They are colorless cells and possess a nucleus. They are the cells of the immune system that are involved in protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders. All leukocytes are produced and derived from a multi-potent cell in the bone marrow known as hematopoietic stem cells. They function in defending the body against pathogens. Some feed on pathogens by phagocytosis and they are called phagocytes. The white blood cell is of different types: lymphocytes and monocytes.\nc) PLATELETS: They are also called thrombocytes. It makes up 0.17% of the blood volume. They are tiny colorless fragment of large bone marrow cells that help blood clot. They have no nucleus and they help to stop bleeding by clumping and forming plugs in blood vessels injuries. Low platelet count often occurs as a result of separate disorder such as leukemia or an immune system problem.\nd) PLASMA:	Plasma is the pale yellow sticky liquid component of blood. In which the red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets are suspended. It is made of 55% of the bloods volume. It carries heat energy. Its components include: 92% of water, glucose, amino acids, 8% of dissolved protein, carbon dioxide, hormones, antibodies, urea, uric acid, vitamins, and minerals. \n', 'introduction', 'HND', '12/69/0312', 'Design of a web based blood bank information management system', 'Mr Orunsolu', '2017-04-18 11:15:19'),
(26, '3.0 	INTRODUCTION\nSystem analysis is a process of collecting factual data, understanding the processes involved, identifying problem and recommending possible ideas for improving the functionality of the system. Its aim is to give birth to a new and efficient system that fulfils the current needs of the user and has scope for future growth within the organizational constraints. \nSystem analysis also includes segmenting complex process involving the entire system, identification of data store and manual processes. \nThe outcome of the analysis helps to give conditions of what the proposed system will do based on the requirements. System analysis studies each component of the proposed system as a unit to determine how well they work and interact with each other to accomplish their purpose. \n3.1	JUSTIFICATION OF METHODOLOGY\nWaterfall model was the first System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model to be widely used in Software Engineering to ensure success of the project. In "The Waterfall" approach, the whole process of software development is divided into separate phase. Every software developed is different and requires a suitable SDLC approach to be followed based on the internal and external factors. Some reasons why the use of Waterfall model is most appropriate are:\n1.	It is a small project\n2.	Requirements are very well documented, clear and fixed\n3.	Product definition is stable\n4.	Technology is understood and is not dynamic\n5.	There are no ambiguous requirements\n6.	Ample resources with required expertise are available to support the product\nIn Waterfall model, the outcome of one phase acts as the input for the next phase sequentially.\nThe sequential phases in Waterfall model are:\n3.1.1 	Requirement Gathering and analysis: \nThis phase identifies the requirements of the proposed system. All possible requirements of the system to be developed are also captured in this phase and documented in a requirement specification document. \n3.1.2	 System Design: \nThe requirement specifications from first phase are studied in this phase and the blueprint of the system is prepared. System Design helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and also helps in defining overall system architecture.\n3.1.3 	Implementation: \nThis phase can also be referred to as coding. With inputs from system design, the source code of the application is written. This source code is integrated in the next phase. \n3.1.4 	Testing: \nThe system is tested against the initially identified requirements. This is to ensure that the application is truly solving the needs gathered during the requirements phase.\n3.1.5 Deployment of system: \nOnce the functional and nonfunctional testing is done, the software is installed in the client environment or released into the market.\n3.1.6 	Maintenance: \nThere are some issues that are likely to arise in the clients environment after the software has been installed and to fix these issues, this phase is required. The software team is responsible for supporting and looking after the application.\nAll these phases are flowed to each other in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases. The next phase is started only after the defined set of goals are achieved for previous phase and it is signed off, so the name "Waterfall Model". \nBelow is a diagrammatic representation of different phases of the waterfall model.\n\nFigure 3.1-Waterfall Model\n\n3.1.7 	MERIT OF WATERFALL MODEL\nWaterfall model enables departmentalization and control. A plan can be set with deadlines for each stage of development and a product can proceed through the development process model phases one by one. Development moves from concept, through design, implementation, testing, installation, troubleshooting, and ends up at operation and maintenance. Each phase of development proceeds in strict order.\n3.1.8 	DEMERIT OF WATERFALL MODEL\nThe disadvantage of waterfall development is that it does not allow for much reflection or revision. Once an application is in the testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change something that was not well-documented or thought upon in the concept stage.\n3.2 	SYSTEM ANALYSIS\nSystems development can generally be thought of as having two major components: Systems analysis and Systems design. \nSystem design is the process of planning a new system, replacing or complementing an existing system but before this planning can be done, one must thoroughly understand the old system and determine how computers can best be used to make its operation more effective. \nSystem analysis then, is the process of gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems and using the information to recommend improvements to the system (Wikipedia, 2015). This is the stage where the proposed project is examined, the study of the functional component that the proposed system will have and how they are expected to function, the connectivity and the relationship of each entity are also discussed. Systems analysis involves more than solving current problems. \nAnalysis specifies what the system should do. Design states how to accomplish the objective.  \n3.2.1 ANALYSIS OF EXISTING MANUAL SYSTEM\nThe existing system is a manual system in which all its processes are carried out manually. Its merits and demerits are described below:\n3.2.1.1 MERITS OF EXISTING SYSTEM\n3.2.1.1.1 Increases employment\nThe existing manual-blood bank management system increases employment in the country because the manual management will necessitate the employment of people to supervise or perform in of the processes carried in a blood bank.\n3.2.1.1.2 No staff training\nThe use of manual management system requires no special training, anyone that can read and write can make use of the manual system. Unlike the computer based system that requires a fundamental knowledge of how to operate a computer system before the staff can make use of it, manual based system needs only the reading and writing skills.\n3.2.1.1.3 Lower setup Cost\nThe cost of starting a manual blood bank management system is very low. Once paper and pen has been purchased a manual management system is almost complete. \n3.2.1.2 DEMERITS OF EXISTING SYSTEM \nThe manual blood bank management system has many demerits; some of them are discussed below:\n3.2.1.2.1 Error prone result\nThe data provided by the manual system is subjected to human error and cannot be trusted, this is a major and most common disadvantage of the manual system.\n3.2.1.2.2 It is time consuming\nThe manual processing of data are generally slow compared to the computerized processing in which information processing is completed under very few seconds.\n3.2.1.2.3 Possible loss of valuable information\nThe issue of quality, encompasses the physical record, storage and retrieval. There are limitations to the physical quality of the paper record. Paper is fragile and does not last permanently. Normal use of the record may result in torn or stained documents. Also, over the years, ink used to complete documentation can fade. Actual damage resulting from water or fire is another threat to the physical integrity of the paper record.\n3.2.2	ANALYSIS OF PROPOSED BLOOD BANK INFORMTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nThe proposed blood bank information management system will be controlled on information technology tools and techniques to improve the management of blood banks by providing a fast and cost effective computer-based system for the recording, processing and retrieval of blood bank activities. Also, hospitals in each states of the country can access the blood banks closest to them. The system is a web application that is readily scalable and adaptable to meet the complex need of blood banks who are key facilitator for the healthcare sector, it also supports all the functionalities of blood banks. \n3.2.2.1 FEATURES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM\n3.2.2.1.1 Automated Report Generation:\nThe proposed blood bank management system will generate automatic report(s) on the various activities of the blood bank on a timely basis\n3.2.2.1.2 Easy retrieval of information\nInformation will always be available to the users. Unlike the manual system that requires the user to go through different registers before he can access a small piece of information, the computer based system will provide an immediate and very easy access to information. \n3.2.2.1.3 Good Security\nThe system provides adequate security by ensuring that only authorized users have access to necessary information. However, any individual that wants to access the system must provide his/her username and password otherwise, a random individual cannot access the system.\n3.2.2.1.4 Good Back-up\nThe system provides a backup database system online to ensure that information are not lost in case of any disaster, This ensures that information is always save regardless of any situation.\n3.2.2.1.5 Cost Efficiency\nThe proposed system is cost effective, it has a very low maintenance cost and also reduces the cost of acquiring human labour.\n3.2.2.1.6 Interactive Management System\nInteractive software accelerates data entry and offers users easy access and helps platform to facilitate their understanding and usage of the system. It also gives non-computing oriented individuals the power to use and understand the system.\n3.2.2.1.7 Sharing the data is possible: \nData can be shared in proposed system .This means that two or more persons can use the same data in existing system provided that they have right to access that data. Also the two or more departments in an organization can easily interact with each other without the actual movement of data. \n3.3	ENTITY RELATIONSHIP AND RELATIONAL SCHEMA FOR THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\nAn entity-relationship diagram (ERD) is a data modeling technique that creates a graphical representation of the entities, and the relationship between entities, within an information system. There are three main components of an ERD, which includes: \n1.	The entity which is the object of interest in the system.\n2.	The relationship which is the interaction between the entities.\n3.	The cardinality which defines the relationship between the entities in terms of numbers. The three main cardinal relationship are; one to one, expressed as 1:1; one to many expressed as 1:M; and many to many expressed as M:M..\n \n\nFigure 3.3: Entity Relationship Diagram\n\n3.4 	USE CASE DIAGRAM\nUse case diagram is a diagram, showing the functionality provided by a system in terms of actors, their goals which is represented as use cases and any dependencies between them.\nA use case is described in terms of a sequence of interactions between some actors and the system by which the system provide a service to the actors. Each use case then captures a piece of functional requirements for some users. All the use cases together describe the overall functional requirements of the system. The first step in requirements capture is to capture requirements as use cases. \n3.4.1 	Patient/Doctor Use-case\nThe patient/doctor use case shows the various activities that the patient/doctor can perform on the system when he/she wants to order for blood from any blood bank. \n \nFigure 3.4.1 Patient/Doctor Use-case\n\n3.4.2 Blood Bank Management System Admin Use-case\nThe Blood Bank Management System Admin use case shows the various activities that the systems administrator can perform on the system.\n \nFigure 3.4.2 Blood Bank Management System Use-case\n\n3.4.3 	Blood Bank Admin/Staff Use-case\nThe Blood Bank Admin/Staff use case shows the various activities that the Admin/Staff that is in charge of managing the blood bank information management system can perform on the system.\n \nFigure 3.4.3 Blood Bank Admin/Staff Use-case\n', 'methodology', 'HND', '12/69/0312', 'Design of a web based blood bank information management system', 'Mr Orunsolu', '2017-04-18 11:16:24'),
(27, 'In an educational system, a large amount of data is kept. This data may be students data, alumni data, teachers data, non-teaching staff data, resource data, and so on. Educational data mining is used in discovering the patterns in these data for decision-making (Osmanbegovic, 2012).\nEducational data mining or normalization can answer a lot of questions from the patterns obtained from student data, questions such as:\n1.      Who are the students at risk of failing in the future?\n2.      What is the quality of student participation?\n3.      Who are the students likely to drop a course?\n4.      What are the chances of student gaining promotion to the next class\n5.      Which courses should a department offer to attract more students?\n6.      How many students should be accepted into the department every session.\nThe results of educational data mining can be used by different members of the educational system such as the examiners, teachers, security officers and the students. Students can use them to identify the activities, resources and learning tasks needed to improve their learning. Teachers can use them to get more objective feedback, to differentiate the stronger students from the weaker students and to guide the weaker students (also considered as students at risk) and help them to succeed. The security officers can use the result of educational data mining to identify and locate students in the case of an emergency. The result of educational data mining can also be used by the institution to identify the most commonly made mistakes and to organize the contents of the institutions website in an efficient way. \nThere are two types of educational systems:\nA.	Traditional education system: The traditional education system involves direct contact between the students and the teacher. Students record which include information such as attendance, and grades may be kept manually or digitally. The performance of students is a measure of this information.\nB.	Web based learning system: The web based learning system is also known as e-learning. It is becoming the more expedient approach towards education and it has become more popular as the students can learn from any place without any time constraint. In the web based education system, various data about the students are automatically collected through logs.\nThis project work describes a model that predicts the academic performance of students in a traditional education system. The following development will help us to understand the relevance of this model because reducing the number of students who fail is the main aim of this project work. Since inferior students are also enrolled into the institutions, the results of the institutions are depreciating when it comes to good grades therefore if we know in advance which students are likely to fail, the institutions or the teachers can take the necessary steps towards improving the results. This will help in improving the quality of graduates that are produced yearly from these institutions (Kabra and Bichkar, 2011).\n1.1	BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\nSince one of the goals of tertiary institutions is to contribute to the improvement of the quality and standard of higher education, the success in the creation of human capital has been a subject of continuous analysis. Hence the prediction of students success is very important to these higher education institutions, because the purpose of any teaching process is to meet students educational needs and enhance overall students academic success. In this regard, important data and information are gathered on a regular basis after which they are used in the prediction of students academic performance (Osmanbegovic, 2012).\nMeasuring and predicting the academic performance of students has been a challenging task since students academic performance depends on diverse factors such as personal, socio-economic, psychological and other environmental variables. But the prediction of students performance is a very important endeavor as it helps the student and teachers to minimize poor academic performances and produce better educated and enlightened students in order to make the society a better place. With the help of performance prediction, a failing student can be identified and helped by putting all the factors affecting the student into consideration and providing solutions to counter this factors so as to facilitate better performance (Brijesh Kumar Bhardwaj and Saurabh Pal, 2011).\n1.2	STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nWithout adequate measures to curb the existing problem of persistent students failure, it will continue to remain a major problem for higher institutions. But with the analysis of the factors which are socio-economic, psychological and environmental, a headway can be made towards curbing the problem of student failure.\n1.3	AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\nThe aim of this project is to predict a students performance using the normalized decision tree method.\n The specific objectives are:\n1.	To identify various factors that affect the performance of students in their academic endeavors.\n2.	To use the identified factors as well as the students past performance to predict the future performance of the student.\n3.	To develop a model which can predict students academic performance using decision tree method.\n1.4	SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\nThis project work titled STUDENTS ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE PREDICTION USING NORMALIZATION attempts to analyze those factors that affect the students academically. Furthermore, this work predicts the future academic performance of students but does not automatically address these problems as the tutors and teachers and even the students themselves still need to take steps towards curbing the performance problem by eliminating this factors themselves.\n1.5	SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n1.	To help teachers and tutors identify weak and strong students so teachers can lay more emphasis on instructions and procedures when dealing with the weak students\n2.	To help the students identify and eliminate those factors either found in the student himself or the school or the society.\n3.	To help the tutors and teachers find solutions to the problems affecting the weaker students so as to enhance overall academic performance.\n\n1.6	DEFINITION OF TERMS\nSTUDENT: A student or pupil is a learner or someone who attends an educational institution. In Britain those attending university are termed "students".\nACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OR (ACADEMIC) PERFORMANCE: is the extent to which a student, teacher or institution has achieved their short or long-term educational goals.\nNORMALIZATION: Is a systematic approach of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy and undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anamolies. It is a multi-step process that puts data into tabular form by removing duplicated data from the relation tables.\nCLASSIFICATION: Is a procedure for selecting a hypothesis from a set of alternatives that best fits a set of observations.

(28, '3.0	RESEARCH AND METHODOLOGY\nBoth of these techniques have their drawbacks. If you have outliers in your data set, normalizing your data will certainly scale the normal data to a very small interval. And generally, most of data sets have outliers. When using standardization, your new data arent bounded (unlike normalization).\n\n3.1	DATA COLLECTION\nA total of 170 records were initially collected. Having deleted data for withdrawn students, the remaining number of records was 158. Each student record had the following attributes: student ID, student name, student grades in quiz1, quiz2, and quiz3, midterm1, midterm2, project, tutorial, final exam, and total points obtained. The distribution of points for the course was 60 for a years work (which included quizzes {1, 2, 3}, midterms {1, 2}, tutorials, the project and the final lab) and 40 points for the final exam. A student must have obtained at least 60 out of 100 to pass the course.\n\n3.2	DATA PREPARATION AND PRE-PROCESSING\nData pre-processing is among the common steps prior to applying any data mining technique. We\napplied the following steps to prepare the data: \n-	Eliminating the records of students who withdrew from the course because some of their relevant values were consequently missing.\n-	Discretizing the total grade attribute into five categories: A, B, C, D, and F.\n-	Discretizing all attributes of the semester into four categories: excellent, good, average, and poor.\n\nFor the research purposes, two forms of data: real numerical values of all attributes except the class attribute under examination (final exam or total) to be categorized, and the second one after categorizing all remaining attributes. The description of the attributes in the final data.\n\n3.3 Data Visualization\nHaving applied the pre-processing techniques to the dataset, we loaded it to the Weka software. We first attempted to analyze the data through visualization prior to applying any normalization algorithm. Specifically, we wanted to observe the distribution of the grades in the final exam as well as the total points, as shown in \n\n \nFigure 1. Distribution of Final Exam Grades.\n\n\n \nFigure. 2. Distribution Of Total Grades For The Course\n\n\nFigure 1 shows that most students performance in the final exam was excellent and only 11 students performed poorly. On the other hand, Figure. 2 shows that a majority (40 students) failed the course, with only 25 students passing with an A grade. This information indicates that final exam points alone cannot be used as an indicator of the success or failure in the course. Prior to the final exam, most students made use of what they learned during the semester through tutorials and projects. This was reflected in their performance in the final test.\nHowever, passing this course depended also on students performance in all the other methods of assessment during the semester.\n\n\n3.4	NORMALIZATION\nNormalization is the process of reorganizing data in a database so that it meets two basic requirements: There is no redundancy of data (all data is stored in only one place), and data dependencies are logical (all related data items are stored together). Normalization is important for many reasons, but chiefly because it allows databases to take up as little disk space as possible, resulting in increased performance.\nNormalization involves arranging attributes in relations based on dependencies between attributes, ensuring that the dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints. Normalization is accomplished through applying some formal rules either by a process of synthesis or decomposition. Synthesis creates a normalized database design based on a known set of dependencies. Decomposition takes an existing (insufficiently normalized) database design and improves it based on the known set of dependencies.\n3.5	OBJECTIVES OF NORMALIZATION\nA basic objective of the first normal form defined by Codd in 1970 was to permit data to be queried and manipulated using a "universal data sub-language" grounded in first-order logic.[5] (SQL is an example of such a data sub-language, albeit one that Codd regarded as seriously flawed.)[6]\nThe objectives of normalization beyond 1NF (First Normal Form) were stated as follows by Codd:\n1.	To free the collection of relations from undesirable insertion, update and deletion dependencies;\n2.	To reduce the need for restructuring the collection of relations, as new types of data are introduced, and thus increase the life span of application programs;\n3.	To make the relational model more informative to users;\n4.	To make the collection of relations neutral to the query statistics, where these statistics are liable to change as time goes by.\nA deletion anomaly. All information about Dr. Giddens is lost if he temporarily ceases to be assigned to any courses.\nWhen an attempt is made to modify (update, insert into, or delete from) a relation, the following undesirable side-effects may arise in relations that have not been sufficiently normalized:\n	Update anomaly. The same information can be expressed on multiple rows; therefore updates to the relation may result in logical inconsistencies. For example, each record in an "Employees'' Skills" relation might contain an Employee ID, Employee Address, and Skill; thus a change of address for a particular employee may need to be applied to multiple records (one for each skill). If the update is only partially successful  the employee''s address is updated on some records but not others  then the relation is left in an inconsistent state. Specifically, the relation provides conflicting answers to the question of what this particular employee''s address is. This phenomenon is known as an update anomaly.\n	Insertion anomaly. There are circumstances in which certain facts cannot be recorded at all. For example, each record in a "Faculty and Their Courses" relation might contain a Faculty ID, Faculty Name, Faculty Hire Date, and Course Code. Therefore we can record the details of any faculty member who teaches at least one course, but we cannot record a newly hired faculty member who has not yet been assigned to teach any courses, except by setting the Course Code to null. This phenomenon is known as an insertion anomaly.\n	Deletion anomaly. Under certain circumstances, deletion of data representing certain facts necessitates deletion of data representing completely different facts. The "Faculty and Their Courses" relation described in the previous example suffers from this type of anomaly, for if a faculty member temporarily ceases to be assigned to any courses, we must delete the last of the records on which that faculty member appears, effectively also deleting the faculty member, unless we set the Course Code to null. This phenomenon is known as a deletion anomaly.\nMinimize redesign when extending the database structure\nWhen a fully normalized database structure is extended to allow it to accommodate new types of data, the pre-existing aspects of the database structure can remain largely or entirely unchanged. As a result, applications interacting with the database are minimally affected.\nNormalized relations, and the relationship between one normalized relation and another, mirror real-world concepts and their interrelationships.\n', 'methodology', 'HND', '12/69/0161', 'student academic performance prediction using normalization', 'Mr Adebayo', '2017-05-02 10:37:30'),
(29, '1.0	BACKGROUND TO THE RESEARCH\nBecause of increasing threats to networked computer systems, there is great need for security innovations. Security practitioners and researchers have made strides in protecting systems and, correspondingly, individual users digital assets. However, the problem arises that, until recently, security was treated wholly as a technical problem  the system user was not factored into the equation. Users interact with security technologies either passively or actively. For passive use understandability may be sufficient for users. For active use people need much more from their security solutions: ease of use, memorability, efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction. Today there is an increasing recognition that security issues are also fundamentally humancomputer interaction issues. Authentication is the process of determining whether a user should be allowed access to a particular system or resource. It is a critical area of security research and practice. Alphanumeric passwords are used widely for authentication, but other methods are also available today, including biometrics and smart cards. However, there are problems of these alternative technologies. Biometrics raise privacy concerns and smart cards usually need a PIN because cards can be lost. As a result, passwords are still dominant and are expected to continue to remain so for some time. Yet traditional alphanumeric passwords have drawbacks from a usability standpoint, and these usability problems tend to translate directly into security problems. That is, users who fail to choose and handle passwords securely open holes that attackers can exploit. The password problem, as formulated by Birget in [33], arises because passwords are expected to comply with two conflicting requirements, namely: Passwords should be easy to remember, and the user authentication protocol should be executable quickly and easily by humans.\nUser authentication is a fundamental component in most computer security contexts. It provides the basis for access control and user accountability. While there are various types of user authentication systems, alphanumerical username/passwords are the most common type of user authentication. They are versatile and easy to implement and use. Alphanumerical passwords are required to satisfy two contradictory requirements. They have to be easily remembered by a user, while they have to be hard to guess by impostor [2]. Users are known to choose easily guessable and/orshorttextpasswords, Graphical passwords (GP) use pictures (Parkinson, 2005) instead of texts and are partially motivated by the fact that humans can remember pictures more easily than a string of characters. The idea of graphical passwords was originally described by Greg Blonder in 1996 and since then several researchers have proposed different graphical password authentication schemes, in Blonders description of the concept an image would appear on the screen, and the user would click on a few chosen regions of it. If the correct regions were clicked in, the user would be authenticated. An important advantage of GP is that they are easier to remember than textual passwords. Human beings have the ability to remember faces of people, places they visit and things they have seen for a longer duration. An important advantage of Graphical Passwords is that they are easier to remember compared to textual passwords. Thus, graphical passwords provide a means for making more user-friendly passwords while increasing the level of security. \n1.2	PROBLEM STATEMENT: \nThe password problem arises largely from limitations of humans long-term Memory (LTM). Once a password has been chosen and learned the user must be able to recall it to log in. But, people regularly forget their passwords. Breakdown and Interference explain why people forget their passwords. Items in memory may compete with a password and prevent its accurate recall (Wixted et al 2004). If a Password is not used frequently it will be even more susceptible to forgetting. A further complication is that users have many passwords for computers, networks, and web sites. The large number of passwords increases interference and is likely to lead to forgetting or confusing conventional passwords (Wixted et al 2004). \nThe first idea for graphical passwords was described by Blonder (1996). His approach was to let the user click, with a mouse or stylus, on a few chosen regions in an image that appeared on the screen. If the correct regions were clicked in, the user as authenticated, otherwise the user was rejected. There are some points to be discussed about the graphical password idea that is the creation and learning of the graphical password because from a human viewpoint, the problem of creating a password is making it memorable so that the user can retrieve it later. In a graphical password system, a user choosing click locations in an image needs to choose memorable locations since there are two issues in memorability: the nature of the image itself and the sequence of click locations, the memory because most existing graphical password systems can be classified as being based on either recognition or cued recall. Recognition involves identifying whether one has encountered an item before. In a graphical password system based on recognition, the user has to be able only to recognize previously seen images. By contrast, pure recall is retrieval without external cues to aid memory, e.g. remembering a textual password that one has not written down and the efficiency and perception of efficiency are important in password systems because users want quick access to systems. Time to input a highly practiced graphical password can be predicted by Fitts Law, which states that the time to point to a target depends on the distance and size of the target. \n\n1.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: \nOne of the major issues in this modern day is security. The process of authentication tries to enhance security but the common means of authentication (use of alphanumeric passwords) today are known to have significant disadvantages. Attackers now have different means of accessing a particular system or account and because of this, other means of authentication are now becoming rampant. Identify and explore the characteristics, schemes, methods of the graphical\npassword and the conventional password as well as existing usability features. Design and develop a new graphical password scheme by using selected\nGraphical Password usability features. Implement and test the new scheme by simulating a prototype of the new scheme. This is where the concept of graphical password authentication comes in, they are cheap, easy to use, offer more security (than text based passwords) and also take into consideration, the user factor. The aim of this report is to create awareness that there is an alternative to using text based passwords and this alternative is secure, cheap and relatively easy to use. \n\n1.4	SCOPE OF THE STUDY\nThis report focuses on graphical password authentication and the different forms commonly used today. It also highlights the advantages graphical passwords have over text based passwords and the forms of attack you can be prone to while using graphical passwords. This report does not delve deep into the traditional form of authentication (text based) and biometric form of authentication. It is also to Design and Develop a graphical password prototype which carries the most usability features to give a usable graphical password system by using Delphi Programming language.\n1.5	JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY \nI selected this research topic because Im interested in finding a more secure alternative to text based passwords. The topic opens my eye to a totally different form of authentication that is easy to use and also more secure compared to text based passwords. \n\n1.6	LIMITATIONS OF STUDY\nThe main limitation of using a graphical password is that they are more vulnerable to shoulder surfing than the traditional text based passwords. An attacker can capture a password by direct observation or by recording the individuals authentication session while inserting passwords in public. This is referred to as shoulder-surfing. Another limitation is that the login process is slow when graphical passwords are used and this can sometimes annoy the user. \n\n1.7	DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nAUTHENTICATION; Authentication is a process in which the credentials provided are compared to those on file in a database of authorized users'' information on a local operating system or within an authentication server. If the credentials match, the process is completed and the user is granted authorization for access.\n\nSYSTEM; A system is a collection of elements or components that are organized for a common purpose\n\nGRAPHICAL; the word "graphical" means pictures; \n\nPASSWORD; A password is a word or string of characters used for user authentication to prove identity or access approval to gain access to a resource which is to be kept.\n', 'introduction', 'HND', '12/85/0071', 'authentication system using graphical password', 'Mr Orunsolu', '2017-05-02 11:33:02');

(30, '3.0				FINDINGS AND METHODOLOGY\n3.1	WHY GRAPHICAL PASSWORDS\nGraphical password authentication is a means of authentication that requires the recall and selection of images or sections of an image inputted during the registration phase in a graphical user interface. Today, access to computer systems is most often based on the use of alphanumeric passwords. Though, users have difficulty remembering a password that is long and random-appearing. Instead, they create short, simple, and insecure passwords. Graphical passwords have been designed to try to make passwords more memorable and easier for people to use and, therefore, more secure. Using a graphical password, users click on images rather than type alphanumeric characters. \n\n3.2	CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AUTHENTICATION METHODS \nDue to recent events of thefts and terrorism, authentication has become more important for an organization to provide an accurate and reliable means of authentication. Currently the authentication methods can be broadly divided into three main areas. Token based, Biometric based, and Knowledge based authentication. \n\n3.2.1 TOKEN BASED AUTHENTICATION: \nIt is based on What You Possess. For example Smart Cards, a drivers license, credit card, a university ID card etc. It allows users to enter their username and password in order to obtain a token which allows them to fetch a specific resource - without using their username and password. Once their token has been obtained, the user can offer the token (which offers access to a specific resource for a time period) to the remote site. Many token based authentication systems also use knowledge based techniques to enhance security. Token based techniques, such as key cards, bank cards and smart cards are widely used. Many token-based authentication systems also use knowledge based techniques to enhance security. For example, ATM cards are generally used together with a PIN number. \n\n\n3.2.2	BIOMETRIC BASED AUTHENTICATION\nBiometrics (ancient Greek: bios ="life", Merton ="measure") is the study of automated methods for uniquely recognizing humans based upon one or more intrinsic physical or behavioral traits. It is based on What You Are. It uses physiological or behavioral characteristics like fingerprint or facial scans and iris or voice recognition to identify users. A biometric scanning device takes a user''s biometric data, such as an iris pattern or fingerprint scan, and converts it into digital information a computer can interpret and verify. Biometric based authentication techniques, such as fingerprints, iris scan, or facial recognition, are not yet widely adopted. The major drawback of this approach is that such systems can be expensive, and the identification process can be slow and often unreliable. However, this type of technique provides the highest level of security. \n\nA biometric-based authentication system may deploy one or more of the biometric technologies: voice recognition, fingerprints, face recognition, iris scan, infrared facial and hand vein thermo grams, retinal scan, hand and finger geometry, signature, gait, and keystroke dynamics. Biometric identification depends on computer algorithms to make a yes/no decision. It enhances user service by providing quick and easy identification. \n\n3.2.3	KNOWLEDGE BASED AUTHENTICATION \nKnowledge Based Authentication (KBA) is based on using What You Know to identify you. For example; a Personal Identification Number (PIN), password or pass phrase. It is an authentication scheme in which the user is asked to answer at least one "secret" question. Knowledge Based Authentication is often used as a component in multifactor authentication and for self-service password retrieval. Knowledge based techniques are the most widely used authentication techniques and include both text-based and picture-based passwords. The picture-based techniques can be further divided into two categories: \n\n3.2.3.1 RECOGNITION BASED GRAPHICAL TECHNIQUES: With recognition-based techniques, a user is presented with a set of images and the user passes the authentication stage by recognizing and identifying the Images he or she selected during the registration stage. Recognition-based systems, also known as cognometric systems or locimetric systems generally require that users memorize a portfolio of images during password creation, and then to log in, must recognize their images from among decoys. Humans have exceptional ability to recognize images previously seen, even those viewed very briefly. \n\n3.2.3.2 RECALL BASED GRAPHICAL TECHNIQUES: With recall-based techniques, a user is asked to reproduce something that he or she created or selected earlier during the registration stage. Recall-based graphical password systems are occasionally referred to as drawmetric system because users recall and reproduce a secret drawing. In these systems, users typically draw their password either on a blank canvas or on a grid (which may arguably act as a mild memory cue). Recall is a difficult memory task because retrieval is done without memory prompts or cues. \n\n3.2.4 HYBRID SYSTEMS: These can be described as the combination of two or more schemes, i.e the combination of recognition and recall based techniques or the combination of textual passwords with graphical password schemes. The process of withdrawing money from a bank with the use of an ATM is an example of a hybrid system. It combines knowledge based authentication methods with token based authentication, the ATM card is the token (something you have) and the PIN required is knowledge based (what you know). \n\n\n3.3 TRADITIONAL AUTHENTICATION TECHNIQUES \nAuthentication has traditionally centered on what you know. This concept has, in the past, been embodied in Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) and passwords. The fallibility of passwords and PINs is exemplified in several well-known shortcomings implicit in their use. For example, people share passwords; they have an inherent difficulty in remembering strong passwords (i.e. those consisting of upper-and-lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters) and, as a consequence, often stick passwords to the desktop for everyone to see. \n\nThe password problem arises largely from limitations of humans long-term memory (LTM). Once a password has been chosen and learned the user must be able to recall it to log in. But, people regularly forget their passwords. Decay and interference explain why people forget their passwords. Items in memory may compete with a password and prevent its accurate recall. A password that is not used frequently will be even more susceptible to forgetting. A further complication is that users have many passwords for computers, networks, and web sites. The large number of passwords increases interference and is likely to lead to forgetting or confusing passwords. Users typically cope with the password problem by decreasing their memory load at the expense of security. First, users write down their passwords. Second, when they have multiple passwords, they use one password for all systems or trivial variations of a single password. In terms of security, a password should consist of a string of 8 or more random characters, including upper and lower case alphabetic characters, digits, and special characters. A random password does not have meaningful content and must be memorized by rote, but rote learning is a weak way of remembering. As a result, users are known to ignore the recommendations on password choice. A survey carried out in the Madonna University Miami boys hostel shows that users choose short, simple passwords that are easily guessable. For example, password, personal names of family members, names of pets, and dictionary words. To users the most important issue is having a password that can be remembered reliably so they can get on with their real work. \n\n3.4 LOCIMETRIC PASSWORDS \nIn locimetric systems, users identify and select specific locations within one or more images. The images act as memory cues to aid recall. Examples of such systems include passpoints and cued click points. \n\n\n3.4.1 PASS-POINTS\nIn PassPoints, a password consists of a sequence of five click-points on a given image (see Figure3.2 ). Users may select any pixel(s) in the image as click-points for their password. To log in, they repeat the sequence of clicks in the correct order, within a system-defined tolerance square of the original click-points. The primary security problem is hotspots: different users tend to select similar click-points as part of their passwords. Attackers who gain knowledge of these hotspots through harvesting sample passwords or through automated image processing techniques can build attack dictionaries and more successfully guess PassPoints passwords. A dictionary attack consists of using a list of potential passwords (ideally in decreasing order of likelihood) and trying each on the system in turn to see if it leads to a correct login for a given account. Attacks can target a single account, or can try guessing passwords on a large number of accounts in hopes of breaking into any of them. his makes the system secure and gives it a better usability. This makes the system secure and gives it a better usability. \n\n\n\n \n\nfig 3.2 password consists of five(5) ordered clicks of an image.\n\n3.4.2 CUED-CLICK POINTS: \nA Cued Click point is a graphical password scheme based on clicks, a cued-recall graphical password technique. Users click on one pixel or one point per image for a sequence of images. The next image is based on the previous click-point. Performance of this is very good in terms of speed, efficiency, fault tolerance and security\nThe claimed advantages are that password entry becomes a true cued-recall scenario, where each image triggers the memory of a corresponding click-point. Remembering the order of the click-points is no longer a requirement on users, as the system presents the images one at a time. Cued Click Points also provides implicit feedback claimed to be useful only to legitimate users. When logging on, seeing an image they do not recognize alerts users that their previous click-point was incorrect and users may restart password entry. Explicit indication of authentication failure is only provided after the final click-point, to protect against incremental guessing attacks. In cued click points, pattern based attacks seem ineffective. Although attackers must perform proportionally more work to exploit hotspots, results showed that hotspots remained a problem. \n\n \n\n\nFig 3.3 users select one click-point per image. The next image displayed is determined by the current click-point.\n\n\n3.5 OTHER GRAPHICAL PASSWORD AUTHENTICATION SCHEMES\n3.5.1 HASH VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUE: \nThis graphical password authentication scheme was based on the Hash Visualization. In this system, the user is asked to select a certain number of images from a set of random pictures generated by a program during the registration stage. Later, the user will be required to identify the preselected images in order to be authenticated. The average log-in time, however, is longer than the traditional approach of using alphanumeric passwords. A weakness of this system is that the server needs to store the seeds of the portfolio images of each user in plain text. Also, the process of selecting a set of pictures from the picture database can be tedious and time consuming for the user. \n\n3.5.2 DRAW A SECRET (DAS)\nThis is the first recall based graphical password authentication to be produced. It allows the user to draw their unique password (figure 3.4). A user is asked to draw a simple picture on a 2D grid. The coordinates of the grids occupied by the picture are stored in the order of the drawing. During authentication, the user is asked to re-draw the picture. If the drawing touches the same grids in the same sequence, then the user is authenticated. Jermyn, et al. suggested that given reasonable-length passwords in a 5 X 5 grid, the full password space of DAS is larger than that of the full text password space. \n \n\nFig 3.4 Draw-A-Secret technique. \n\n3.5.3 PASSFACE : \nPassface is a technique developed by Real User Corporation (Real User Corporation, 2006). The basic idea is as follows; the user will be asked to choose four images of human faces from a face database as their future password during registration. In the authentication stage, the user sees a grid of nine faces, consisting of one face previously chosen by the user and eight decoy faces (figure 3.5). The user recognizes and clicks anywhere on the known face. This procedure is repeated for several rounds. The user is authenticated if he/she correctly identifies the four faces. The technique is based on the assumption that people can recall human faces easier than other pictures. Studies have shown that Pass faces are very memorable over long intervals. With the use of pass faces, there are four(4) different rounds of authentication. During registration, the user selects four (4) faces as his/her password. At the authentication stage the user is presented with nine (9) different faces in each round of authentication. The user is only authenticated after the final round of selection. One significant drawback of using pass face is the problem of shoulder surfing. \n\n \nFig 3.5 Examples of passfaces-Realuser.com \n\n3.6 IS A GRAPHICAL PASSWORD AS SECURE AS TEXT BASED PASSWORD? \nVery little research has been done to study the difficulty of cracking graphical passwords. Because graphical passwords are not widely used, in practice there is no report on real cases of breaking graphical passwords. Here, some of the possible techniques for breaking graphical passwords are examined and are compared with text-based passwords. These techniques include: \n\n3.6.1. BRUTE FORCE SEARCH \nThe main defense against brute force search is to have a sufficiently large password space. Text-based passwords have a password space of 94^N, where N is the length of the password, 94 is the number of printable characters excluding SPACE. Some graphical password techniques have been shown to provide a password space similar to or larger than that of text-based passwords. Recognition based graphical passwords tend to have smaller password spaces than the recall based methods. It is more difficult to carry out a brute force attack against graphical passwords than text-based passwords. The attack programs need to automatically generate accurate mouse motion to imitate human input, which is particularly difficult for recall based graphical passwords. Overall, we believe a graphical password is less vulnerable to brute force attacks compared to text-based password. \n\n3.6.2 DICTIONARY ATTACKS \n\nSince recognition based graphical passwords involve mouse input instead of keyboard input, it will be impractical to carry out dictionary attacks against this type of graphical passwords. For some recall based graphical passwords, it is possible to use a dictionary attack but an automated dictionary attack will be much more complex than a text based dictionary attack. More research\nis needed in this area. Overall, it is believed that graphical passwords are less vulnerable to dictionary attacks compared to text-based passwords. \n\n3.6.3 GUESSING \n\nUnfortunately, it seems that graphical passwords are often predictable, a serious problem typically associated with text-based passwords. For example, studies on the Passface technique have shown that people often choose weak and predictable graphical passwords. Studies revealed similar predictability among the graphical passwords created with the DAS technique. More research efforts are needed to understand the nature of graphical passwords created by real world users. \n\n3.6.4 SPYWARE \n\nExcept for a few exceptions, key logging or key listening spyware cannot be used to break graphical passwords. It is not clear whether mouse tracking spyware will be an effective tool against graphical passwords. However, mouse motion alone is not enough to break graphical passwords. Such information has to be correlated with application information, such as window position and size, as well as timing information. \n\n3.6.5 SHOULDER SURFING \n\nLike text based passwords, most of the graphical passwords are vulnerable to shoulder surfing. At this point, only a few recognition-based techniques are designed to resist shoulder-surfing. None of the recall-based based techniques are considered should-surfing resistant. \n\n3.6.6 SOCIAL ENGINEERING \n\nComparing to text based password, it is less convenient for a user to give away graphical passwords to another person. For example, it is very difficult to give away graphical passwords over the phone. Setting up a phishing web site to obtain graphical passwords would be more time consuming. \n\nOverall, it is believed graphical passwords are more difficult to break down using the traditional attack methods like brute force search, dictionary attack, and spyware. There is a need for more in-depth research that investigates possible attack methods against graphical passwords. \n\n3.7 ADVANTAGES \n\ni. The system is resistant against Brute-force attack as the password space is large. \n\nii. The system uses objects instead of human faces which can be used for selecting a password because during the latter phase\niii. Graphical passwords are not vulnerable to dictionary attacks. \niv. It is less convenient for a user to give away graphical passwords to another person. \nv. Flexible and Reliable.\n\n\n\n3.8 DISADVANTAGES \ni. Password registration and login process takes too long login process is slow \nii. Most users are not familiar with the graphical passwords; they often find graphical passwords less convenient and time consuming. \niii. Graphical passwords are prone to shoulder surfing.

(31, '5.1 Summary: \n\nThe past decade has seen a growing interest in using graphical passwords as an alternative to the traditional text-based passwords. In this report is a comprehensive research on existing graphical password techniques. The current graphical password techniques can be classified into two categories: recognition-based and recall-based techniques. Although the main argument for graphical passwords is that people are better at memorizing graphical passwords than text-based passwords, the existing user studies are very limited and there is not yet convincing evidence to support this argument. My research suggests that it is more difficult to break graphical passwords using the traditional attack methods such as brute force search, dictionary attack, or spyware. However, since there is not yet wide deployment of graphical password systems, the vulnerabilities of graphical passwords are still not fully understood. \n\n\n5.2 Recommendation: \n\nAlthough the use of graphical passwords is not as secure as other forms of authentication like the use of biometric means of authentication (very expensive). Text-based passwords should be replaced with graphical passwords because they are more secure. My recommendation to future researchers is that other means of eliminating the shoulder surfing problem attached with the use of graphical passwords. \n\n5.3 CONCLUSION \nGraphical passwords are an authentication method that uses pictures as passwords instead of using alphanumeric characters. They are attractive since humans normally remember pictures better than words. In this project a secure graphical authentication system named Pass Matrix that protects users from becoming victims of shoulder surfing attacks when inputting passwords in public. User has to choose their pass image from a collection of available pictures. To hide the pass-image from the attackers Generic Visible Watermark Embedding technique is used to blend a cover image and a pass-image. It is easy for legitimate users to recognize the pass-image in the blended image. On the other hand, this task is difficult for attackers. This method is extended to secure web applications by using QR  \n', 'conclusion', 'HND', '12/85/0071', 'authentication system using graphical password', 'Mr Orunsolu', '2017-05-02 11:38:53'),
(32, '1.0	INTRODUCTION \nThe act of plagiarizing is when you use someone''s else words and ideas without giving due credits to the original writer and regard the work as your own (Wikipedia, 2017). \nPlagiarism is defined by (Hannabuss, 2011) as is the act of imitating or copying or using somebody elses creation or idea without permission and presenting it as ones own. Plagiarism is similar to the act of stealing. If the act of stealing someone''s car, watches, cell phone and others is punishable by law, surely the act of stealing someone ideas, thoughts, writings or words is also considered wrongful. However, this does not mean that students should not view other''s works or sources for references. Taking in opinions and ideas from experts in order to increase knowledge is a good thing, but most importantly is to make sure that the origin of the sources and the relevant cited references are duly credited. Failure to credit the original writer is considered as plagiarism. If someone is caught for committing plagiarism in a college or a university, the consequences could be severe, from failing the course to being expelled from the institution. Recently German Defense minister Karl-Theodor zu resign after being surrounded by a plagiarism scandal at University of Bayreut in PhD. \nPlagiarism in coding is not entirely a new phenomenon. The issue has been discussed and studied previously by researchers to identify the severity of the problem and what factors contribute to the act of plagiarism. In programming assignment, plagiarism does not necessary only involve copying the source code but if someone include comments, program input data and interface designs that can also be considered as plagiarizing. In 2012 the people start show concerns about plagiarism in source code. A survey in 2014 shows that 85.4% in a class of 137 students at Monash University and 69.3% in a class of 150 students at Swinburne University are involved in source code plagiarism and they admit this dishonesty. Both samples show a high tendency among students to cheat or plagiarize. Involvement of students in plagiarism is due to many reasons like sometime there are some drawbacks in checking assignments in academics and sometime student just feel lazy to write his own code. One example of its practice in programming courses is when a student submits work of which part was copied from another students work, assuming that instructors will not find out about the truth. \nGenerally, plagiarism in coding is hard to be detected because of the similar coding used for the same application. Plagiarism in coding is easy to do, but difficult to detect (Wagner N., 2015). \nStudents copy all or part of a program from some source or from different sources and submit the copy as their own work. This includes students who collaborate and submit similar work. Such plagiarism is felt to be common, though the true extent is hard to assess. \n\n1.2 	PROBLEM STATEMENT\nIn this scenario, the Java code files that the students have been submitting, as part of their assignments are not being analyzed using the plagiarism detection program that have been written in Java so their might be error and dubbing of assignment.\nWith the help of the plagiarism detection, it will help to solve some problems in submission of java assignments. \n	Every new submitted Java code file is being compared with the other students assignments to detect plagiarism. \n	In this case, ''our system'' must be scalable because of the increasing number of Java code files.\n \n1.3 	AIMS AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\nThe goal of is to create a plagiarism detection tool to assist lecturers in higher institutions to detect plagiarism of Java code in students assignments. \n	The program will enable lecturers to identify the authenticity of students works by comparing the submitted assignments with the other students assignments. \n	Lecturers will be able to detect if the students commit plagiarism, if the comparison between two Java files resulted in at least threshold value or higher degree of similarity. \n	The second goal of the thesis is to analyze the normalization techniques. \n	The normalization techniques are applied to the plagiarism detection tool, in order to analyze the data. \n	Based on the result, the technique with the highest percentage is considered to be more reliable in detecting plagiarism in Java codes and thus, will be recommended. \n\n\n\n1.4	SCOPE OF STUDY\nThe motivation to carry out the research is based on the need for a program that is able to simplify the task of lecturer in checking accurately through students coding of Java files, line by line in ensuring no duplication is being made from other sources. \n	This is to avoid too much time spent on examining a single assignment and to ensure that equal time is given on the checking of each assignment. \n	The research includes suggestion on different methods in detecting plagiarism in Java code files and recommendation on best approaches for future work and study references. \n1.5	LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\nThe following are limitation of the study\n1.	It is restricted to plagiarism detection.\n2.	Only java code assignment will be checked on the application\n\n1.6	DEFINITION OF TERMS\nPLAGIARISM: The practice of taking someone else''s work or ideas and passing them off as one''s own.\nPLAGIARISM DETECTION: Is the process of locating instances of plagiarism within a work or document. The widespread use of computers and the advent of the Internet has made it easier to plagiarize the work of others. Most cases of plagiarism are found in academia, where documents are typically essays or reports.\n', 'introduction', 'HND', '15/98/0009', 'plagiarism detection in java code file using normalization and levenstien algorithm', 'Mr Leke Adebayo', '2017-05-15 11:40:46'),
(33, '3.1	DESIGN METHODOLOGY\nThe plagiarism detection tool works in two steps. First it needs to convert Java code into a form which is easy to compare. This is to be done in the Normalization phase. After normalization the LEVENSHTEIN distance Algorithm will work on normalized files to detect plagiarism in Java code. \n \nFigure 3.1: Main Idea\n\n3.2	NORMALIZATION \nNormalization is the process of rewriting all Java files in a certain way that will simplify the comparison later on. Normalization can be applied on two formats i.e. Source file or Token stream. It includes: \n\n Removing comments. \n Uniform renaming of identifiers. \n Sorting of all class members according to their size. \n3.2.1 Removing Comments \nThe first step of normalization is to delete all comments of Java files. It is knowing that comment have no effect on functionality of a code. It will remove comments because someone can just add extra comments in code so that it looks different from copied one. Comments can also affect the results of our plagiarism detection tool, as the algorithm it will be comparing the source code character by character or token by token after normalization phase.\n\n3.2.2 Uniform Renaming of Identifiers \nIn the second step it will rename fields and methods of classes. It will choose to rename full class or either just fields or just methods of class. It will be renaming of identifiers because if a student who want to copy code of his fellow can just change the name of fields and methods of Java code to make it look like different. This is the easiest way in programming assignments to copy code. \n\n3.2.3 Sorting of all Class Members According to their Size \nIn the third step of normalization, class members will be sorted in ascending order of a selected Java file. Class members that will be sorted in this order; fields will come first on top then after fields constructors will come and at the end methods of the classes. Methods of class are sorted on the basis of statements i.e. if a method has two statements and other have three statements then the method with two statements will come first and the method with three statements will be sorted after this. Inner classes are sorted according to number of methods in classes. Reason for sorting of class members is that, if a code of 200 lines exist and someone just change the order of fields, methods, constructors and of inner classes then it is very difficult to detect code plagiarism. \n\n3.3	Levenshtien Algorithm \nThe Levenshtien Distance Algorithm (LD) measure the similarity between source string(s) and target string(t). The similarity between two strings is measured as distance between source and target string. Number of substitutions, insertion and deletion required to convert source strong into target string are referred as difference between these files. The Lavenshtien Algorithm result increase with difference between the strings. If source string(s) is "fellow" and target string (t) is "follow" then LD=1. It means that one substitution is required to change source string into target string. If s is "this thesis is related to plagiarism" and t is "the thesis is about plagiarism", then LD(s,t) = 10. Levenshtien distance was used in Plagiarism Detection. It is also been used in Spell Checking, Speech recognition and DNA Analysis. \n\n3.3.1 Explanation \nThis algorithm will calculates the number of operations needed to change String1 to String2. We will explain it manually here. Suppose we want to calculate Levenshtien Distance between strings MORNING and EVENING. First of all we will have to take MORNING and EVENING horizontally and vertically in Rows and Columns in a table. It does not matter which string we are taking horizontally or which one vertically. We have to insert one extra row and one extra column in the table. Now we will fill first row and first column from left to right and top to bottom in ascending order from 0...n and 0m. The table after this step will become like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 3.2.1 After First Step\nThe illustration on how the normalization process will operates.\nNow the real part begins after this. Its the calculation part. We start it by checking the column of E (from Evening) from top to down, then V from top to down and so on We have to match letter in the column with the letter in the line. If they match then we simply put the value Above Left cell in the matching cell. If they do not match then we have to take minimum of three values and add 1 to it. The three values will be from cell above, above left and left of current cell. Lets take E from EVENING and M from MORNING. They are not matching so we have to take minimum of cell above(that is 1) , above left(that is 0) and left(that is 1) of current cell. Minimum is 0 here. When we add 1 in 0 then it will become 1 which we put in current cell.\n\nThe goal will be to calculate the similarity of two strings. Knowing that Levenshtein Distance algorithm gives us difference between two strings. Max(CS,ST) will give us larger length value of either of target string or of source string. We are taking Max(CS,ST) to divide the distance value because it will need to calculate percentage of similarity, explaining this formula with a simple example Suppose \n= \n= \nThen by applying Levenshtein Distance algorithm =14 \n , =19 (Length of CS) Lets put these values in our formula \n= 1(,) 100 = 11419 100 = 26  =26.\n\nThis means that 26 % is similarity between two strings. If this value of plagiarism will be more than threshold value then we suppose that source file is plagiarized with target Java file and the result, names and location of both files will be shown. \n\n3.4	Token Stream \nWhen characters of a Java program are grouped into symbols then it is called as token. A token can be an identifier, keyword, separator, operator, literal and comment. Programmer choose the identifies; keywords are names that are already defined in a programming language; separators are punctuators; operators are symbols that produce results by operating arguments; Literals can be Numeric Textual, Logical and reference and comments are line or block. Although Comments are accepted as token by the Java compiler, it abandons these for further processing.\n', 'methodology', 'HND', '15/98/0009', 'plagiarism detection in java code file using normalization and levenstien algorithm', 'Mr Leke Adebayo', '2017-05-15 11:41:52'),
(34, 'INTRODUCTION\nBACKGROUND\nMedical diagnosis is diagnosis in the field of medicine, that is the determination of which disease or condition is causing a persons signs and symptoms. It is simply called diagnosis when the medical context is implicit. Both the process of determining which disease or condition is present and the conclusion that is reached by this process is called diagnosis (for example, the process of diagnosis can yield a diagnosis of strep throat). Diagnosis is also the process of determining the nature of a disease, or disorder and distinguishing it from other possible conditions. The term comes from a Greek gnosis, meaning knowledge. Diagnosis is the identification of the nature and cause of a certain phenomenon. Diagnosis is used in many different disciplines with variations in the use of logics, analytics, and experience to determine cause and effect. In systems engineering and computer science, it is typically used to determine the causes of symptoms, mitigations and solutions.\nThe foundation of diagnosis is always the information from the history and the physical examination, but often one or more diagnostic procedures, such as diagnostic tests, are also done during the process. Diagnosis is often challenging, because many signs and symptoms are non-specific. For example, redness of the skin (erythema), by itself, is a sign of many disorders and thus doesnt tell the physician what is wrong. Thus differential diagnosis, in which several possible explanations are compared and contrasted, must be performed. This involves the correlation of various pieces of information followed by the recognition and differentiation of patterns. Occasionally the process is made easy by a sign or symptom (or group of several) that is pathognomonic.\nDiagnosis is a major component of the procedure of a doctors visit. From the point of view of statistics, the diagnostic procedure involves classification tests. The diagnostic process is the method by which health professionals select one disease over another, identifying one as the most likely cause of a persons symptoms. Symptoms that appear early in the course of a disease are often more vague and undifferentiated than those that arise as the disease progresses, making this the most difficult time to make an accurate diagnosis. Reaching an accurate conclusion depends on the timing and the sequence of the symptoms, past medical history and risk factors for certain diseases, and a recent exposure to disease. The physician, in making diagnosis, also relies on various other clues such as physical signs, non verbal signals of distress, and the results of selected laboratory and radiological and other imaging tests. From the large number of acts obtained, a list of possible diagnoses can be determined, which are referred to as differential diagnosis. The physician organizes the list with the most likely diagnosis given first.\nAdditional information is identified, and appropriate tests are selected that will narrow the list or confirm one of the possible disease. Traditionally, diagnosis has been defined as the art of identifying a disease from its signs and symptoms. Formerly, few diagnostic test were available to assist the physician, who depended on medical history, observation and examination.\nComputer assisted technique have been proposed in the past to help solving the diagnostic problem. Computer-based methods are increasingly used to improve the quality of medical services. Mostly the remote areas, the population are deprived of the facilities of having experts to diagnose disease. So it is the need of the day to store the expertise of specialist in computers through using ES technology. After that they can consult the specialist doctor if it is necessary or serious. Rule based expert system includes both conventional techniques, such as database management systems, and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as knowledge based systems or expert systems. Medical diagnosis is a very active field as far as introduction of the above techniques is concerned.\nIn medical diagnosis, DBMSs are used for storing, retrieving and generally manipulating patient data, whereas ESs are mainly used for performing diagnoses based on patient data, since they can naturally represent the way experts reason.\nThe best clinicians excel in their ability to discern the correct diagnosis in perplexing cases. This skill requires an extensive knowledge base, keen interviewing and examination skills, and the ability to synthesize coherently all of the available information. Unfortunately, the level of expertise varies among clinicians, and even the most expert can sometimes fail. There is also a growing appreciation that diagnostic errors can be made just as easily in simple cases as in the most complex.\nGiven this dilemma and the fact that diagnostic error rates are not trivial, clinicians are well advised to explore tools that can help them establish correct diagnoses. Clinical diagnosis support systems can direct physicians to the correct diagnosis and have the potential to reduce the rate of diagnostic errors in medicine.\nIn healthcare, diagnosis codes are used as a tool to group and identify diseases, disorders, symptoms, poisonings, adverse effects of drugs and chemicals, injuries, and other reasons for patient encounters.\nDiagnostic coding is the translation writ ten descriptions of diseases, illnesses and injuries into codes from a particular classification. In medical classification, diagnosis codes are used as part of the clinical coding process alongside intervention codes. Both diagnosis and intervention codes are assigned by a health professional trained in medical classification such as clinical coder or Health Information Manager.\nSeveral diagnosis classification systems have been implemented to various degrees of success across the world. The various classification have a focus towards a particular patient encounter type  such as emergency, impatient, outpatient, mental health as well as surgical care. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) is one of the most widely used classification systems for diagnosis coding as it allows comparability and use of mortality and morbidity data.\n As the knowledge of health and medical advances arise, the diagnostic codes are generally revised and updated to match the most up to date current body of knowledge in the field of health. The codes may be quite frequently revised as new knowledge is attained.\nDIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES\nA diagnosis, in the sense of diagnostic procedure, can be regarded as an attempt at classification of an individuals condition into separate and distinct categories that allow medical decisions about treatment and prognosis to be made. Subsequently, a diagnostic opinion is often described in terms of a disease or other condition, but in case of a wrong diagnosis, the individuals actual disease or condition is not the same as the individuals diagnosis.\nA diagnostic procedure may be performed by various health care professionals such as a physician, physical therapist, optometrist, healthcare scientist, chiropractor, dentist, podiatrist, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. A diagnostic procedure (as well as the opinion reached there by) does not necessarily involve elucidation of the etiology of the disease or conditions of interest, that is, what caused the disease or condition. Such elucidation can be useful to optimize treatment, further specify the prognosis, or prevent recurrence of the disease or condition in the future.\nDIAGNOSTIC OPINION\nHowever, a diagnosis can take many forms. It might be a matter of naming the disease, lesion, dysfunction, or disability. It might be a management naming or prognosis-naming exercise. It may indicate either degree of abnormality on a continuum or kind of abnormality in a classification. Its influenced by non-medical factors such as power, ethics and financial incentives for patient or doctor. It can be a brief summation or an extensive formulation, even taking the form of a story or metaphor. It might be a means of communication such as a computer code through which it triggers payment, prescription, notification, information or advice. It might be pathogenic or salutogenic. Its generally uncertain and provisional. Indication for diagnostic procedure. The initial task is to detect a medical indication to perform a diagnostic procedure. Indication procedure include:\nDetection of any deviation from what is known to be normal, such as can be described in terms of, for example, anatomy(the structure of the human body), physiology (how the body works), pathology(what can go wrong with the anatomy and physiology),psychology(thought and behavior) and human homeostasis (regarding mechanisms to keep body systems in balance). Knowledge of what is normal and measuring of the patients current condition against those norms can assist in determining the patients particular departure from homeostasis and the degree of departure, which in turn can assist in quantifying the indication for further diagnostic processing a complaint expressed by a patient.\nThe fact that a patient has sought a diagnostician can itself be an indication to perform a diagnostic procedure. For example, in a doctors visit, the physician may already start performing a diagnostic procedure by watching the gait of the patient from the waiting room to the doctors office even before she or he has started to present any complaints. Even during an already ongoing diagnostic procedure, there can be an indication to perform another, separate, diagnostic procedure for another, potentially concomitant, disease or condition. This may occur as a result of an accidental finding of assign unrelated to the parameter of interest, such as can occur in comprehensive tests such as radiological studies like magnetic resonance imaging or blood test panels that also include blood test panels that also include blood tests that are not relevant for the ongoing diagnosis.\nGeneral components, which are present in a diagnostic procedure in most of the various available methods include: Complementing the already given information with further data gathering, which may include questions of the medical history (potentially from other people close to the patient as well), physical examination and various diagnostic tests.\nThere are a number of methods or techniques that can be used in a diagnostic procedure, including performing a differential diagnosis or following medical algorithms. In reality, a diagnostic procedure may involve components of multiple methods.\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe method of diffential diagnosis is based on finding as many candidate diseases or conditions as possible that can possibly cause the signs and symptoms, followed by a process of elimination or at least of rendering the entries more or les probable by further medical tests and other processing until, aiming to reach the point where only one candidate disease or condition remains as probable. The final result may also remain a list of possible conditions, ranked in order of probability or severity. The resultant diagnostic opinion by this method can be regarded more or less as a diagnosis of exclusion. Even if it doesnt result in a single probable disease or condition, it can at least rule out any imminently life-threatening conditions.\nUnless the provider is certain of the condition present, further medical tests, such as medical imaging, are performed or scheduled in part to confirm or disprove the diagnosis but also to document the patients medical history up to date. If unexpected findings are made during this process, the initial hypothesis may be ruled out and the provider must then consider other hypotheses.\nPATTERN RECOGNITION\nIn pattern recognition method the provider uses experience to recognize a pattern of clinical characteristics. It is mainly based on certain symptoms or signs being associated with certain diseases or conditions, not necessarily involving the more cognitive processing involved in a differential diagnosis. This may be the primary method used in cases where diseases are obvious, or the providers experience may enable him or her to recognize the condition quickly. Theoretically, a certain pattern of signs and symptoms can be directly associated with a certain therapy, even without a definite decision regarding what is the actual disease, but such a compromise carries a substantial risk of missing\\a diagnosis which actually has a different therapy so it may be limited to cases where no diagnosis can be made.\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\nThe prime objective of this topic Medical Diagnosis System is to enhance the medical authorities to improve diagnostic in Mapoly healthcare center. This system enables an individual to access medical details and prescription from their mobile accessories.

(35, 'DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY\nSYSTEM ANALYSIS \nBefore the design of any system, be it stand alone, web, or web based application, etc. the process to be involved in its design will have to be critically analyzed and its boundary clearly established. System Analysis is the detailed study of the various operations performed by the system and their relationships within and outside the system. Analysis is the process of breaking something into its parts so that the whole may be understood. System analysis is concerned with becoming aware of the problem, identifying the relevant and most decisional variables, analyzing and synthesizing the various factors and determining an optional or at least a satisfactory solution. During this a problem is identified, alternate system solutions are studied and recommendations are made about committing the resources used to system.\nDESCRIPTION OF PRESENT SYSTEM\nPresently, diagnosis is done by doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers. Diagnosis involves doing some checkup, and talking or describing symptoms to doctors who in return would prescribe drugs or advice patients\nCOMPONENTS OF THE MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC APP\nThe medical diagnostic application has some various components which helps in detecting, and providing an output the user understands. Some of the components include:\n1.	Loading Alert: This enables the user to know the state of application even if the app looks as if it''s not responding due to the age of the mobile device its on or the version of the operating system.\n2.	Text to Speech: The text to speech feature is a powerful feature which enables people with disabilities such as eye problems to use the application. The text to speech converts the text on each page of the application, and reads it out for the user to understand.\n3.	Orientation Sensor: This is a component of the application which checks the state of the mobile phone the application is being used. Using the phone gravity sensor, the application changes the screen orientation and enlarges the text on the application so as to make it easy to read the content of the application.\n4.	Default Language: The medical application tries to detect the language encoded on the android mobile device, and also the country the mobile phone is being used in order for it to provide a powerful reporting.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF PRESENT SYSTEM\nFrom the way diagnosis is being carried out,it encourages patient with less severe ailments to visit the hospital, thereby congesting hospital which leads to the following:\na)	Waste of time\nb)	Loss of life\nc)	Long queues \nd)	Over work doctors\n\nPROPOSED SYSTEM\nFrom the weakness of the present system, we knew that going to the hospital all the time could be stressful and also not good for emergency cases. In order to solve this, we developed an android application that helps makes it easy to diagnose sickness without seeing the doctor. This application can be used in emergency cases before a patient is taken to a hospital.\nMEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC MENU\nThe medical diagnostic mobile application can be used to detect diseases affecting three major body parts which are:\n	Skin related diseases\n	Eye defects\n	Teeth diseases.\nSKIN DISEASES: These are various diseases that users can contact easily, such as Eczema, Psoriasis, Rosacea. Some of these diseases spread over a large body area, disfiguring the user''s skin.\nEYE DEFECTS: These are various defects that can make the eyes not to function well or see properly. These including cataracts, bulging eye etc.\nTEETH DISEASES: These are teeth problems which may lead to the over sensitivity of the teeth to hot or cold substances such as food or beverage etc. Some of the complications includes\n	Tooth decay\n	Swelling of the gum\n	Sinus headache\nDISEASE DATA COLLECTION\nDATA COLLECTION: This is a term used to describe a process of preparing and collecting data for example as part of a process of improvement of similar project. The purpose of data collection in this diagnostic mobile application is to know the body parts that are more prone to infections, and the diseases that are common to these parts. Justification is done by gathering and collecting data using various data collection methods such as experimental methods and direct interview.\n1.	EXPERIMENTAL METHOD\nThis is a method often used to generate scientific data. This is used to generate reliable data and it is done by inviting knowledge workers to interact with the system. The result is analyzed and compared with existing result.\n2.	DIRECT INTERVIEW\nThis is used to gather fact and information by talking to people one after the other, and then compare the result of the outcome. To actualize this, there was a session if interrogation with some knowledge workers (Clinical Staff). This was done to know what they feel about the existing system and how to improve on the current process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Context Diagram \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n	No\n\n\n                                                      Yes\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 1: Medical diagnostic system mobile application flow chart\n', 'methodology', 'HND', '12/69/0176', 'mobile health medical diagnostic system', 'Mr Orunsolu', '2017-05-16 11:30:59'),
(36, 'INTRODUCTION \nSeveral network systems are built to communicate with one another and are made available through service-oriented architectures. In this project, we use the client server architecture to develop a secured Client-Server chat application. A chat application is created based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) where TCP is connection oriented protocol and in the end, multithreading is used to develop the application (Bhatt , 2015). \nA client-server chat application consists of a Chat Client and a Chat Server and there exists a two-way communication between them. Here, Message Processor is used to interpret message from the user, Message Interpreter is used to extract and pass the received message. Message Maker is used to construct back the message and Client Manager is used to maintain the clients list which the sender and receiver at both sides use to interact with each other (Bhatt, 2015). \n\nIn general, the server process will start on some computer system; in fact, the server should be executed before the client. Server usually initializes itself, and then goes to wait state or sleep state where it will wait for a client request. After that, a client process can start on either the same machine or on some other machine. Whenever the client wants some service from the server, it will send a request to the server and the server will accept the request and process it. After the server has finished providing its service to the client, the server will again go back to sleep, that is, waiting for the next client request to arrive. This process is repeated as long as the server processes is running. Whenever such request comes, the server can immediately serve the client and again go back to the waiting state for the next request to arrive (Hancke, G.P, 2014). \n\n1.2 	STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM \nThe client-server communication model is used in a wide variety of software applications. Where normally the server side is sufficiently protected and sealed from public access, but client applications running on devices like notebooks and desktops are considered insecure and exposed to security threats. \nThe main weakness of client-server chat application is that there is no security provided to data which is transferred between clients. Any unauthorized client can hack the client account and can change the data. This is the main objective of this project (To develop a secured Client-Server Chat Application and File Sharing). \n\n1.3 	OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY \nThe aim of this project is to develop a reliable and secure network programming (Client-Server chat model) which can perform a multithreaded server client chat application based on Java socket programming using Transport Control Protocol (TCP). As security is the key factor while communicating over a network, hash function with salt is used for the Database based on a number of benefits. MySQL became the choice for the implementation of this application based on its scalability and flexibility, high performance, high availability, strong data protection, web and data warehouse strengths, management ease, lowest total cost of ownership and open source freedom. \n\n1.4	 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY \nApart from just performing the regular client server chat, this client-server chat is robust and significant in the following ways: \nThis project use MySQL for its database to make information in the database secure. The personal details and messages including the private messages in the Database are encrypted using encrypt or (one of the security facilities available in the MySQL). \nThis project implements hash function with the password before the encryption and then stored in the Database. It also uses random generated numbers (salt) that is calculated together with the passworded hash values and stored in the Database. As a result, even if the database is compromised, the salt added to hash values makes it harder to compute the original password. This random salt is used with the hash function to significantly increase the strength of encrypting passwords and thus makes cracking greatly impossible. This makes the chat application server reliable and more secured.\nAnother significance of this application is private chatting. This is where two users can chat in private. The messages between the users are not displayed / seen in the general chat display text field. The messages are displayed only within the private message display text field. \n\n1.5	 SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS\nThe project shall consider among other things the following issues: \n1.	To provide a better understanding of how network programming in java works. \n2.	Develop a reliable network communication for a Client-Server chat application. \n3.	Analyses of network programming in java (Multithreaded Client-Server Chat applications) for better understanding of the solutions. \n4.	Conduct an experimental result in order to establish the parameter of the problem. In conclusion, suggest ways the problems can be eliminated and recommends how the problems can be prevented. \nLIMITATIONS \nThe previous Client-Server Chat system implements only hash function with the password before the encryption which is then stored in the Database. Thus, the database can be compromised easily to compute the original password. \nSome drawbacks of the Client-Server Chat are as follows: \n	As the server receives as many requests from clients so there is a chance that server can become congested and overloaded. \n	In case of server fails then the users also suffers. \n	A lost password is irrecoverable. \n	Any unauthorized client can hack the client account and can change the data. \n\n1.6	 DEFINITION OF TERMS \nSocket: Socket is a standard connection protocol that supports data communication over the network between connected terminals. The standard connection supports the data transmission both by the TCP and UDP protocols between the terminals. \nTCP: TCP is a transport layer protocol used by applications that require guaranteed delivery of data. Basically, it is a connection-oriented protocol. To communicate over TCP one must first have to establish a connection between pair of sockets, where one socket is client and the other belongs to server. After the connection is established between them then they can communicate with each other. \nClient: A client is a system that accesses or desires for a service made accessible by a server. \nServer: A server is a system (hardware or software) program running to provide the service requests of other system programs. \nPort: Port is a software mechanism that allows the centralized connected Servers to listen for requests made by clients. Port is actually purposed as a gateway to listen for the requested parameters by the server terminals or other machines. It is a software address on a system that is on the network. Entire request response proceeding among this Application is carries through machine ports. \nNetwork: This refers to a system were computers are linked to share software, data, hardware and resources for the benefit of users. \nInterface: This may be software or hardware that upon an agreed method spells out the manner a system component can exchange information with another system component. \nSecure socket layer (SSL): This refers to Secure Sockets Layer protocol that is used for encryption of data for secure data transmission. \nIP: This refers to Internet Protocol; it is the reasonable network address of device on a network. It is notational called dotted-decimal (for instance: 128.1.0.1). \nThread: A thread is a section of code which is executing independently of others threads in a same program. Java has a class Thread which is defined in java.lang package. Thread is the most powerful feature that JAVA supports from other programming languages.\n', 'introduction', 'HND', '12/69/0279', 'a file sharing and chatting application system using a secured channel algorithm (tcp)', 'Mrs Alaran', '2017-05-16 12:53:51'),
(37, 'SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN\n3.1	 METHODOLOGY \nThe Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology (SSADM) is a well-defined (structured) methodology. It is an integrated set of standards and guides for the analysis and design of computer systems. It is an integrated set of standards and guidelines consisting of: \n\n	Structural standards: This defines the structure of a development project in the form of explicitly defined tasks, with clearly defined interfaces between them, and clearly defined tangible products. \n	Technique guides: This provides development staff with a set of proven usable techniques and tools, and detailed rules and guidelines on when and how to use them; and \n	Documentation standards: This provides the means of recording the products of development activity at a detailed level. \n\nSSADM is waterfall method by which an Information System design can be arrived at; SSADM can be thought to represent a pinnacle of the rigorous document-led approach to system design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure3.1: The waterfall model\nBenefits of the Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology (SSADM) \n1. Deliver the system to users on time: SSADM has a modular structure which relates directly to project deliverables and helps in all aspects of project management. It gives a clear specification of what is to be produced and how it is to be managed and reviewed. There are well defined interfaces to management and specialist techniques. \n2. Deliver systems that meets user''s needs: By continuously involving users, by modeling business activities and work practice, by using prototyping, by making the IT professional''s thinking visible through diagrammatic techniques, SSADM enhances the prospects for success on large and small projects. \n3. Improve quality by reducing error rates: Quality can be improved by detecting errors early in the lifecycle, especially by involving users as well as skilled practitioners in checking for errors. Rigorous techniques promote accuracy, with adequate checks of completeness and consistency. By defining the required quality of design documents, and stating the tests for them, SSADM promotes better quality management. \n4. Improve flexibility: Every application development is different. The ability of tailoring SSADM to suit different projects is a major factor for organizations who wish to reuse their resource skills on other projects, and to be able to benefit from the many different ways in which SSADM techniques and products may be applied. \n5. Avoid IT developers bureaucracy: SSADM has been designed to provide useful tools for project managers and to transfer expertise to practitioners. Its use makes benefits, as well as costs, visible to both business and IT management and users. \n\nSTAGES INVOLVED IN STRUCTURED SYSTEMS ANALYSIS AND DESIGN METHODOLOGY\nThe SSADM method involves the application of a sequence of analysis, documentation and design tasks concerned with: \n\n1.	Feasibility Stage \nAnalyze the current situation at a high level. A Data Flow Diagram is used to describe how the current system works and to visualize known problems. The following steps are part of this stage: \n\n	Investigate and define requirements. \n	Investigate current processing. \n	Investigate current data. \n\n2. Analysis Stage \nThe first part is researching the existing environment, where system requirements are identified and the current business environment is modeled. Modeling consists of creating a Logical Data Structure for processes and data structures that are part of the system. The following steps are part of this stage: \n\n	Requirements Specification Stage \n	Define required system processing. \n	Develop required data model. \n	Derive system functions. \n	Develop specification prototypes. \n	Develop processing specification. \n\n3. Logical System Specification Stage \nIn this stage, technically feasible options are chosen. The development/implementation environments are specified based on this choice. The following steps are part of this stage: \nLogical System Specification Stage \n	Define user dialogue. \n	Define update processes. \n	Define enquiry processes. \n\n4.	Physical Design Stage \nThe objective of this stage is to specify the physical data and process design, using the language and features of the chosen physical environment and incorporating installation standards. The following activities are part of this stage: \n	Prepare for physical design. \n	Complete the specification of functions. \n	Incrementally and repeatedly develop the data and process designs.\n\n3.2    PRIMARY DATA COLLECTION \nThe process of information gathering was achieved through so many sources including: \n	Oral interview of users of existing system \n	Textbooks in the library \n	Newspaper, Journals and articles \n	Other publications \n\n3.2.1     SECONDARY DATA COLLECTION \n	File downloads from the Internet \n	Electronic media \n\n\n\n3.3 ANALYSIS OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM \nThe existing Client-Server Chat system use TCP Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that is connection oriented. It is reliable; it guaranteed that each packet will arrive and also guaranteed that packets will be in the right order. All personal details and messages including the private messages in the Database are encrypted.\nIt implements only hash function with the password before the encryption and then stored in the Database. Thus, the database can be compromised easily to compute the original password. \n\n3.4	LIMITATIONS OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM \nSince the existing system implements only hash function with the password before the encryption and stored in the database, the password in the database can be hacked easily because hash function can be decrypted easily using hash calculator. \nThe main weakness of the existing client-server chat application is that there is no security provided to data which is transferred between clients. Any unauthorized client can hack the client account and can change the data. \n\n3.5	SYSTEM DESIGN \nThis Client-Server Chat system use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that is connection oriented. It is reliable; it guaranteed that each packet will arrive and also guaranteed that packets will be in the right order. All personal details and messages including the private messages in the Database are encrypted. This project implements hash function with the password before the encryption and then stored in the Database. Also, this use random generated numbers (salt) that is calculated together with the passworded hash value and stored in the Database. Thus, even if the database is compromised (random generated salt added to hash value) makes it harder to compute the original password. Therefore, makes the server more secured. This chat system implements real network connection. To implement the application on a real network, MySQL must be installed on the server host. The client system must have all the classes compiled without error. Thereafter, the user can start and use the same server IP address and Port number to be able to establish connection with the server. \nJAVA.NET Class: Java can be used easily to develop network applications. It comes with a very powerful class library for networking as part of java.net package. The java.net package will have to be included at the beginning of the program for network input and output methods operations. By using TCP, the server runs first and then waits for clients requests and sever has ability to either accept or deny the client request. A server has a socket which is bound to a specific port. Client programs send connection request to the server program and if everything is well then server accepts the connection. After accepting the client request the server gets a new socket bound to a different port, it requires a new socket bound because the original socket has to listen to other connection requests.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Client Sending Connection Request to Server\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Client-Server Connection Established by using TCP\nSocket Programming with TCP \nTCP (Transfer Control Protocol) is a stream communication protocol basically its a connection-oriented protocol. To communicate over TCP one must firstly have to establish a connection between pair of sockets, where one socket is client and the other belongs to server. After the connection is established between them then they can communicate with each other. \n\nClient Program in JAVA: \n1.	To communicate with server program, the client has to create socket by writing the following statement: \nSocket client = new Socket(server, port_id);\nWhere server is the machine name you are trying to open a connection to and port_id is the port number on which server and client are trying to connect. Port numbers have range from 0 to 65536, but port numbers range from 0 to 1023 are reserved for system use so select only the port number greater than 1023 which are also available. The code written above cannot handle the exceptions so the above code can be written as following, to handle the exceptions: \nSocket client;\ntry {\nclient = new Socket(server,port_id );\n}\ncatch (IOException e) {\nSystem.out.println(e);\n}\n2.	The next step of the client program is to create an input, output stream to communicate with the server. For this purpose use java DataInputStream for input and DataOutputStream or PrintStream for output. Following is the code used to create an input stream to receive data from server: \ninput = new DataInputStream(client.getInputStream()); \nString line = input.readLine(); \nAnd following is the code used to create an output stream to send data to the server socket: \noutput = new DataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream()); \noutput.writeBytes(Hello\\n); \n3.	The last step is to close socket but before closing the socket input and output stream must be closed. Following the code for closing the socket: } \ncatch (IOException e) { \nSystem.out.println(e); \n} \nA Simple TCP Server Program in JAVA: \n1.	To communicate with client program first server have to create socket by writing the following statement: \nServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(PortNumber);\nHere again there is need to mention the PortNumber on which server and client are trying to connect. The code written above cannot handle the exceptions so the above code can be written as following, to handle the exceptions: \nServerSocket server; \ntry { \nserver = new ServerSocket(PortNumber); \n} \ncatch (IOException e) { \nSystem.out.println(e); \n} \n2. In the server program, server also has to wait for client connection request and after getting client request, the server has either to accept or deny the request. The following is the code below to listen and accept the client request: \n\nSocket clientSocket = null; \ntry { \nserverSocket = server.accept(); \n} \ncatch (IOException e) { \nSystem.out.println(e); \n}\n3. In the server program, use java DataInputStream to receive input from client and use DataOutputStream to send information to client. Following is the code used to create an input stream to receive data from client: \ninput = new DataInputStream(server.getInputStream()); \nString line = input.readLine(); \nAnd following is the code used to create an output stream to send data to the client socket: \noutput = new DataOutputStream(server.getOutputStream()); \noutput.writeBytes(Hello\\n); \n\n4. The last step is to close socket but before closing the socket input and output stream must be closed. Following the code for closing the socket: \ntry { \noutput.close(); \ninput.close(); \nserverSocket.close(); \nserver.close(); \n} \ncatch (IOException e) { \nSystem.out.println(e);} \nClient-Server Chat Application using TCP in JAVA: \nA chat application is basically a combination of two applications: \n	Server application \n	Client application \n\nServer application runs on the server computer and client application runs on the client computer. In chat application, a client can send data to anyone who is connected. Either data can be directly sent to anyone who is connected or it can be sent by informing server. This application uses the second method, because in this case client is connected to only server and can communicate with many clients and server doesnt transmit the IP of client to anyone which increases the security of the client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Client-Server Chat Application by using TCP\nBefore start chatting, the client must have to establish a connection with the server. In this application, we have one server and many clients who can communicate to each other via server. Client must encode the data in the language which is understandable by both the server and the other client. The chat application will work in the following sequence: \n	A client can chat only if its authenticated, so firstly a client must authenticate from by sending its id. The id of each client must be unique. \n\n	The server maintains a list of authenticated clients and sends the list to all authenticated clients. \n	The Server can send any message to any client, and the server also has the authority to disconnect any client from chat system. \n	A client can send messages or chat with any authenticated clients. \n\nServer Execution: \nFirstly, all the clients have to connect with server, for this purpose server should have to listen for client connection requests. So at server side, firstly a thread is created which accepts the client connection request. \nImplementation of a simple server program in java which can implement the client illustrates when a client program connects to this server, it sends a welcome message back to the client, then it will expect the client to send some data and whatever data it received from client, it will simply echo it back, one line at a time. \nMulticasting: In case clients wants to do a group chat then it sends request to the server and in answer, server provides a group IP to the client and send information about the room to all the concerned clients. Now when clients send a message then it will multicast to all the clients in group IP. In case of system failure, it may be server sender or receiver that failed then there will be three stages which can be show using following figure 3.5:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5 Three Stages of System failure\n	In case system of sender get failed at stage 1 then packet will save in the queue and will not send until sender recovers but in case when receiver fails then packet will not be received. \n	In case of sender fails at stage 2, the packet is already sent from the sender buffer and now it is on the way. In this condition, the receiver will receive the message but if at this stage it fails then, the message will not be received. \n	In case sender get fails at stage 3, the packet is in receivers buffer so it has no impact but in case if receiver fails then the packet is placed in receiver buffer so as soon as receiver recovers it will get the message. \nThread: A thread is a section of code which is executing independently of others threads in a same program. Java has a class Thread which is defined in java.lang package. Thread is the most powerful feature that JAVA supports from other programming languages. \nMultithreaded Client-Server Chat Application: In a multithreaded chat application a client will use two threads to interact with standard input and with server. At server side there will be a separate thread for each client. Whenever a client wants to establish a connection then a new client thread is created. A multithreaded chat application will work like this: \n	On the server side there will be a main thread which will continually listens to a given port. \n	The client program client will send a request to establish a connection by sending the users username. \n	After establishing the connection, another thread is spawned to open a dialog box for chatting with clients. \n	At the server side for each connection there will be separate thread. \n	The Server program will maintain a list of all online clients and send that list to all clients who are currently available. \n	If a client logs out, then the server will update its list and forward that updated list to all online clients. \n\nDeadlock: A deadlock situation will occur when two threads are circularly dependent on each other e.g. thread1 is holding an object which is needed by the thread2 to complete its execution and thread2 is holding the same object for which thread1 is waiting so both of them waiting for each other to release the resource so in this condition a deadlock is created because thread1 and thread2 are circularly dependent on each other. \n\nLocks: While using resources threads can use locks to prevent from lock situation. Locks allow java threads to quickly and easily communicate with each other. If a thread is holding a lock on an object then no other thread can use that object. \nIn java each object has a lock by using synchronized keyword. Synchronized blocks can only be executed by one thread at a time. \nSynchronizing Thread: When two or more threads need access to a shared resource, there should be a means through that resource will be used by only one thread at a time. The procedure through which this synchronization is obtained is called thread synchronization. \nThe synchronized, a keyword in Java, is used to create a block of code referred to as a critical section. The following is the syntax of synchronized statement in java: \nsynchronized(object) { \n// statements to be synchronized \n} \n3.6	SYSTEM FLOW CHART\n\n \nCreate new socket  		accept the connection of the client\nFigure 3.6: Multithreading Flow Diagram\n3.7	TOP DOWN DIAGRAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Client  Server Chat Application Architecture\nHere Message Processor is used to interpret message from the user. Message Interpreter is used to extract and then parse the received message. Message Maker is used to construct back the message whereas Client Manager is used to maintain the clients list, whereas sender and receiver at both sides are used to interact with each other.\n\n3.8	JUSTIFICATION OF THE NEW SYSTEM \nThis system implements hash function and salt for Data encryption which makes the system greatly difficult to crack. \nAnother significance of this application is private chatting. This is where two users can chat in private. The messages between the users are not displayed / seen in the general chat display text field. The messages are displayed only within the private message display text field.\n', 'methodology', 'HND', '12/69/0279', 'a file sharing and chatting application system using a secured channel algorithm (tcp)', 'Mrs Alaran', '2017-05-16 12:55:44'),
(38, 'INTRODUCTION          \n1.1	BACKGROUND INFORMATION\nClinic Billing System is an automated package for managing patient records and billing flow. With the use of this software technology, hospitals can save time and money and also minimizes human error in handling patients billing records. The CBS combines practice management software, electronic medical record (EMR) software and patients registry software. Clinic Billing System will simplify handling of patients records which is essential part of medical practice using. The system will support simultaneous users who logged into the system at the same time, resulting in an organized paperless work.\nFor several decades, clinic billing was done almost entirely on paper. However, with the introduction of information technology into hospital management system also known as health information system has become possible to efficiently manage large amount of medical records using computer and allied technologies. Many software companies have risen to provide similar software to this particularly lucrative segment of the market.  \nThis system will provide patients and workflow support modules to facilitate the clinic administrative activities and create interfaces among the multiple technologies in the clinic. The result is increased efficiency by speeding up workflow and making patient records easier to access by eliminating physical paper work and by making patient scheduling more robust through computerisation unlike the manual process. \n\n\n1.2	STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\nThe major problem of the existing clinic billing system which deals with a large number of people is that it is difficult to ensure availability of all information about a particular patient appropriately at time.\nThe problem that continually confronts the clinic management is accounting calculations that arise from billing department which has made some of the patients.\nThe manual way of billing the patient has given rooms to some of the staff to calculate wrongly or remit false billing values to the management or their documents. Clinic billing system will help to reduce all sort of stealing or wrong calculations. There will be a form of visual appearance and staff patient transactions being carried out.\nThe problem of the existing system is listed below:\nLack of immediate retrieval: - The information is very difficult to retrieve and to find particular information e.g. - To find out about the patients history, the user has to go through various registers. This results in inconvenience and waste of time.  \nLack of immediate information storage: - The information generated by various transactions takes time and efforts to store them.  \nError prone manual calculation: - Manual calculations are error prone and takes a lot of time, this may result in incorrect information. For example, calculation of patients bill based on various treatments.  \nPreparation of accurate and prompt reports: - This becomes a difficult task as business intelligence is difficult, this is due to lack of information collation (ability to put information together and analyze them).  \n1.3	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\nThis project is aimed at retrieving information about patients record and most especially computation of the bills to be paid.\nThe ultimate objective of this proposed project work is to overcome and minimize some of the problem encountered by the existing system. Computerising a manual system will actually reduce the setback associated with the manual system.\nAutomating clinic billing system through the use of computer on the manual work is done on records such as:\n1.	Cards of patient which are kept either in numerical or alphabetical order, in order to be able to keep this information on a long term basis and the record will not be misplaced or lost easily.\n2.	Records about patient payment for treatment are kept in a notebook which is liable to some of the information being kept lost during the loan of the booklet for assessment.\n3.	Record about the bill tells the amount charged, the patient and the traction paid one of it and statistical information about the total amount of money realized either monthly or yearly.\n4.	Since the beds are checked manually, it takes a lot of time to ascertain an empty bed and in case of emergency, the affected patient case get worse due to wasted time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4	MOTIVATION\nClinic billing system will solve some of the problems in the current method of which some of them are:\ni.	Impersonation during the patient registration period\nii.	Delay in billing calculation and processes.\niii.	Cost of resources by department, such as wood sheets, database form etc.\niv.	Mistake may occur in registering some of the patient in manual method.\nv.	Running helter skelter from one office to another during the process of registering of patient.  \n\n1.5	SCOPE AND LIMITATION\nIn designing a computerised system for the clinic it requires a detested study of the clinic itself. With the investigation made, i discovered that the management is categorised into the following.\ni.	Staff record management \nii.	Patient record management \niii.	Hospital naming management\nThe project will only be restricted to patient record management in Rabbit Soaga Clinic. Above all the limitation of the study is that the computerised about the patient record management only.\n1.6	JUSTIFICATION\nThe research work is really for use in a typical clinic, most especially to reduce problems associated with managing the patients billing records.  \nThe use of clinic billing system will greatly reduce human effort and workloads. The call for this topic is a clear consideration to increase productivity in an typical health care facility.\n1.7	DEFINITION OF TERMS  \n\ni.	Clinic: A place or hospital department where patients are given medical treatment or advice.\nii.	General patient card: This can be only the category of patient for his/her registration in the hospital weather an out or in the hospital weather an out or in patients. These card must be firstly filled before any patient is been treat of because it consist of all information of the patient.\niii.	Patient Reference Personal Card: This is the card in indicating that the patient has registered with the clinic. It looks like identity card and consist of some field such as folder number and specific file.\niv.	Daily Report: These are the sheet transactions of patient are recorded. It consist of number of daily admission number of daily discharges patient trisect drugs to patients e.t.c      \nv.

(39, 'RESEARCH AND DESIGN METHODOLOGY\n3.1 DESIGN METHODOLOGY\nIn the course of developing this project, I engaged in a consultative research mode so as to gather enough requirements and data items to be used. I focused in using a direct interview and participating discussion among one another for effective project justification, and also I downloaded sampled projects over the internet at www.seminar+projects.com.\nThese modes of data collection processes are fully explained below:\n3.1.1 DIRECT INTERVIEW: This is the process of meeting sampled study in a one to one communicating process so as to collect efficient data about the topic of discussion. I went to Rabiat Soaga Health Centre in Moshood Abiola Polytechnic so as to interview few of the matron and nurses about their procedures of executing their attendance process and what type of data they keep in record considering the patient, staff, and appointment, including the mode of generating billings.\n3.1.2 ONLINE CONSULTATION: Since its very complex to determine the outlook without seeing a sampled related design, we had to consult the internet to extract and download sampled project so as to support my design process and also gather historical source of some progressive attendance marking process.\n\n3.2 DESIGN METHODOLOGY\nWhile executing the design process, some tools are preferentially chosen for the system development with reasons to justify why these tools are selected. An Object Oriented Programming Language called Java was used alongside with its development kit JDK and MySql database server for database development of the system to store and retrieval of data. These two Software tools are interconnected with an object to database connecting tools provided by every computer system known as the ODBC Data Source which was made happened by Installing MySql Odbc Connector. The diagram below shows the relationship and flow between these tools:\n \nFigure 3.1: System Tools Data Connection Mode\n3.2.1 PROGRAMMING TOOL: Java is an object based programming language used to design both system and application software. It is an advance development programming that succeeds C, and C++. The major reason behind the choice of java over all other programming language is that it is capable of executing on any system platform, and it filters out memory that are not being used  after building and compilation is being done. \n3.2.2 DATABASE TOOL: Database is needed for easy storage, retrieval, and update of data-items generally refers to as a repository for data. There are several choices of databases but the one being chosen as a database choice is MySql due to the luxurious acquisition of data, its flexibility in querying of database, and its no selective connection to all computer object oriented languages (it is compatible with any object oriented programming language).\n3.2.3 ODBC DATA SOURCE: The ODBC simply means Object Database Connectivity, it is a tool supported by all computer system developed passing the normal standards to supports all database relation with object oriented programming languages while there exists the subjected database connector (after installation). It is the system registrar that keeps track of available databases in a system.\n\n3.3 DATABASE DESIGN ARCHITECTURE\nThe system architecture only use and recognize a single database, this database is named clinicbiling which consists of three database tables for storing medical associated records like: doctors information, sickness information, department data and user management information. Each of the table communicates with the system interface for example; if you are to manage patients information, the system will communicate with patients table. These database tables are: appointments, patients, and staffs; the hierarchy and description shot shows the architecture of the system database and its tables each is also being tabulated with their attributes below:\n \nFigure 3.2: Hierarchy of Clinic Billing Database\n3.3.1 APPOINTMENTS: This table stores concurrent appointments that patients had with the clinic.
